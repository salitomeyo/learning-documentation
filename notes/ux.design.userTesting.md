We task our user to do an action in the application, the we watch, we are supposed to let the user perform the task on their own, we need to know if our application is intuitive (only help them if they are really stuck)

## WHY

Lean UX is all about testing all the time at every stage of your design, you dont know the impact of your design decision unless you test it

Testing is how you know your design works or not, think like a scientist and decide like a lawyer

`Not testing is accumulating risks` with every design decision

## WHEN

All the time, as much as possible, in the industry it's best to test once a wwek or every other week, `Always be testing (ABT)`

Your design doesn't need to be perfect or complete to test it, dont wait until its too late

Do concept level testing with paper prototypes, tons of testing during wireframe level and in the visual stage too, if you add a bunch of new screens or change existing interactions, then you should test and iterate

## HOW

### 1. Select Scenarios

What are the scenarios you are going to task people to do in your application

### 2. Create specific tasks

Once you have choosen the scenario you want to test we have to create questions to guide our user through that specific work-flow

### 3. Testing-guide

A testing-guide or user-testing script goes through each scenario and guides the user through the screens with questions related to the screen and section been shown

## Template

We can use the following [[User testing script template|assets/documents/the_user_testing_script.pdf]]

The goal of the user testing is 

* Validate design solution
* Ensure that your content makes sense to the user
* Validate your workflow is usable

### Best practices

Its best to always do the interview with an interviewer and a note taker, record the session, we can is different tools such as 

* Quick time (pc)
* Lookback participate (mobile)

> Note: Dont try to test mobile applications in pc, this insights will probably be futile 

#### The verbiage

Change the wording in the frameworks if you hear multiple users repeatedly calling something with a different name than the one presented

#### The expectation

When you see a user trying to click an interactive element ask them "what do you think that will do?"

#### The walk through

The best opening line when the user sees a new screen is "walk me through, tell me what everything means"

#### Validate

Its important to think decision through, just because something is painful and confusing for one user means it will be confusing for multiple users, dont change things to accomodate to everyones opinion, make sure at least 3 users have the same set backs before taking action

1. Create an unvalidated wireframe
2. Define the task you want the users to achieve
3. Create questions to learn more about how the user interacts with every screen
5. Do synthesis and clustering of themes
6. Validate or invalidate the wireframe
7. Revisit and update the wireframe with the validations
