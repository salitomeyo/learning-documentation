## What is the game designer's goal?

A game designer does not care about games. Games are merely a means to an end. Games are worthless unless people play them. Why is this? When people play games, they have an experience. It is this experience that the designer cares about. **Without the experience, the game is worthless**. We are about to enter territory that is very difficult to talk about because it is too familiar. Everything we've ever seen, done, thought, or felt has been an experience. 

By definition, we can't experience anything that is not an experience. Experiences are so much a part of us, they are hard to think about (even thinking about experiences is an experience). But, as familiar as we are with experiences, they are very hard to describe. You can't see them, touch them, or hold them — you can't even really share them. No two people can have identical experiences of the same thing — each person's experience of something is completely unique. 

This is the paradox of experiences. On one level, they are shadowy and nebulous, and on another, they are all we know. But **as tricky as experiences can be, creating them is all a game designer really cares about**. We cannot shy away from them, retreating into the concreteness of our material game. **We must use every means we can muster to comprehend, understand, and master the nature of human experience.**

## The Game Is Not the Experience

**The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience.** The ancient Zen question addresses this directly: *"If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"*. If our definition of *sound* is air molecules vibrating, then yes. If our definition of sound is the experience of hearing a sound, then no. 

As designers, we don't care about the tree we care only about the experience of hearing it. If no one is there to hear it, well, we don't care at all. **Game designers only care about what seems to exist. The player and the game are real.**

**The experience is imaginary, game designers are judged by the quality of this imaginary thing because it is the reason people play games.** If we could create experiences that are in no way limited by the constraints of the medium that delivers the experiences we would do it.

All we can do is create artifacts (rule sets, game boards, computer programs) that are likely to create certain kinds of experiences. But we are far removed from what we are actually trying to create. **We create an artifact that a player interacts with, and cross our fingers that the experience that takes place during that interaction is something they will enjoy**. We never truly see the output of our work, since it is an experience had by someone else and, ultimately, unsharable. This is why deep listening is so essential for a game design.

## Is this unique to games?

No, designers of all types of entertainment have to cope with the same issue: *How can you create something that will generate a certain experience when a person interacts with it?* But **the split between artifact and experience is much more obvious for game design**.

**Game designers have to cope with much more interaction.** For other designers there is a fairly direct mapping between what they create and what the reader or viewer experiences. **We give the player a great deal of control over the pacing and sequence of events in the experience.** We even throw in random events! This makes the distinction between artifact and experience much more obvious and at the same time it makes it much harder to be certain just what experience is really going to arise in the mind of the player.

So, why do we do it? We do it for the experience it creates. There are certain feelings: **feelings of choice, feelings of freedom, feelings of responsibility, feelings of accomplishment, feelings of friendship**, and many others, which only game-based experiences seem to offer. This is why **we go through all the trouble to generate experiences that can be had no other way**.

## Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows

> There ain't no rules around here! We're trying to accomplish something! – Thomas Edison

So we need to create games that will somehow generate wonderful, compelling, memorable experiences. To do this, **we must uncover both the mysteries of the human mind and the secrets of the human heart**. No one field of study has managed to perfectly map this territory, but several different fields have managed to map out parts of it. Three stand out: 

* **Psychology:** Understand mechanisms that make people tick
* **Anthropology:** Understand people in a human level
* **Design:** Make people happy

### Psychology

Who better for us to learn the nature of human experience from than psychologists, the scientists who study the mechanisms that govern the human mind?

They are scientists forced to work in the realm of what is real and provable. Early in the twentieth century:

* **The behaviorists** focused only on measurable behavior, taking a "black box" approach to the study of the mind using controlled experimentation. They focus on objective, repeatable experiments 
* **The phenomenologists** focused on the nature of human experience and "the feeling of what happens" using introspection. Their approach is necessarily subjective. Experiences themselves cannot be directly measured - only described, and described imperfectly. When an experiment takes place in your mind, how can you possibly be sure the experimental conditions are controlled? - 

Game designers can make use of both behavioristic experiments and phenomenological introspection to learn what we need to know, since **we are not concerned with what is definitely true in the world of objective reality, but only with what seems to be true in the world of subjective experience.**

### Antrophology

> Anthropology is the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities. – Alfred L. Kroeber

Anthropology is a **major branch of study about human beings and what they think and do**. Takes a much more holistic approach than psychology, looking at everything including physical, mental, and cultural aspects of people. Studying the similarities and differences between the various peoples of the world, not just today, but throughout history.

Of particular interest to game designers is the approach of cultural anthropology, the study of living people ways of life. Cultural anthropologists live and try to immerse themselves completely in the world of the people they are trying to learn about. **They strive for objective observation of culture and practices, and they engage in introspection taking great pains to put themselves in the place of their subjects.** To gain a better imagine what it "feels like" to be their subjects.

We can **learn by taking a cultural anthropologist's approach to our players, interviewing, learning everything and putting ourselves in their place, we can gain insights** that would not have been possible from a more objective point of view.

### Design

We will be able to learn useful things from almost every kind of designer. The incredible variety of **design "rules of thumb" do an excellent job of illustrating useful principles about human experience** but these principles can often be hard for us to use. 

To use principles from other areas of design, we will need to cast a wide net. Anyone who creates something that people are meant to experience and enjoy has something to teach us. Ideally, we would find ways to **connect all the varied principles of design to each other through the common ground of psychology and anthropology, since ultimately all design principles are rooted in these**.

Perhaps one day these three fields will find a way to unify all their principles. Since these are three fields that seldom have much crosspollination. 

None of these approaches can solve all our problems, so we will mix and match them, trying to use them appropriately.** We must be both open-minded and practical — good ideas can come from anywhere, but they are only good for us if they help us create better experiences.**
 
## Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice

Let's now focus on one tool that has been used by all three disciplines:

Introspection is the seemingly simple act of examining your own thoughts and feelings — that is, your own experiences. In one sense, it is all you can know. **By deeply listening to your own self, observing, evaluating, and describing your own experiences, you can make rapid, decisive judgments** about what is and is not working in your game, and why it is or is not working.

There are two main perils associated with using introspection:

### Peril #1: Introspection Can Lead to False Conclusions About Reality 

What seems to be true in our personal experience is not necessarily really true. Socrates, noted that when we learn something new, it often feels like we knew it all along. This is an interesting observation, most people can remember a learning experience that felt this way. But Socrates then forms an elaborate argument that since learning can feel like recollection, we must then be reincarnated souls who are just now remembering what we learned in past lives.

This is the problem with drawing conclusions about reality based on introspection — **just because something feels true, it doesn't mean it is true.** 

> People very easily fall into the trap of building up structures of questionable logic to back up
something that feels like it must be true. 

Introspection certainly has its place in science — it allows one to examine a problem from points of view that mere logic won't allow — but don't draw scientific conclusions from it.

Fortunately for us, game design is not science! While "objective truth about reality" is interesting and sometimes useful to us, **we primarily care about what "feels like it is true"**
 
Aristotle is famous for the depth of his personal introspection, his ideas about physics and natural history are largely discredited today because he relied too much on what felt true. So why do we remember him as a genius, and not as a crackpot? Because his other works, about metaphysics, drama, ethics, and the mind, are still useful today. **In these areas where what feels true matters more than what is objectively, probably true**, most of his conclusions, reached through deep introspection, stand up to scrutiny thousands of years later.

**`When dealing with the human heart and mind, and trying to understand experience and what things feel like, introspection is an incredibly powerful, and trustworthy tool.`**

As game designers we care more about how things feel and less about what is really true. Because of this, we can often confidently trust our feelings and instincts when making conclusions about the quality of an experience.

### Peril #2: What Is True of My Experiences May Not be True for Others

This peril is the peril of **subjectivity, and a place where many designers fall into a trap: "I like playing this game, therefore it must be good"**. And sometimes, this is right. But other times, if the audience has tastes that differ from your own, it is very, very wrong. Some designers take extreme positions

#### "I will only design for people like me, because it is the only way I can be sure my game is good"

* Game designers tend to have unusual tastes. There may not be enough people like you out there to make your game a worthwhile investment.
* You won't be designing or developing alone. Different team members have different ideas about what is best, can be hard to resolve.
* There are many kinds of games and audiences that will be completely off-limits to you.

#### "Introspection and subjective opinions can't be trusted. Only playtesting can be trusted"

* You can't leave every decision to playtesting, especially early in the process, when there is no game yet to playtest. At this point someone has to exert a personal opinion about what is good and bad.
* Before a game is completely finished, playtesters may reject an unusual idea. They sometimes need to see it completed before they can really appreciate it. If you don't trust your own feelings about what is good and bad, you are at playtesters will.
* Playtesting can only happen occasionally. Important game design decisions must be made on a daily basis.

The way out of this peril is to listen. Introspection for game design is a process of not just listening to yourself, but also of listening to others. **Once you have a clear picture of how your experience differs from others, you can make predictions about what experiences they will and will not enjoy**. It is a delicate art that must be practiced — and with practice your skill at it will improve.

### Dissect Your Feelings

It is not such a simple thing to know your feelings. It is not enough for a designer to simply have a general sense. **You must be able to clearly state what you like, what you don't like, and why**. This kind of experience dissection is a main goal of your introspection — it is something designers must do. 

When you play a game, you must be able to analyze how it made you feel, what it made you think of, and what it made you do. You must be able to state this analysis clearly. You must put words to it, for feelings are abstract, but words are concrete, and you will need this concreteness to describe to others the experiences you want your game to produce. 

In fact, you should be able to analyze any experience you might have. The more you analyze your own experiences, the more clearly you will be able to think about the kinds of experiences your games should create.

### Defeating Heisenberg

But there is still a greater challenge of introspection. **How can we observe our own experiences without tainting them, since the act of observation itself is an experience?** We face this problem quite often. Try to observe how you breathe and you will forget. Some call this "paralysis by analysis" and others refer to it as the Heisenberg principle. 

This principle, points out that the motion of a particle cannot be observed without disturbing the motion of that particle. Similarly, **the nature of an experience cannot be observed without disturbing the nature of that experience.** This makes introspection sound hopeless. While it is a challenging problem, there are ways around it that are quite effective, though some take practice.

#### Analyze Memories

One good thing about experiences is that we remember them. Analyzing an experience while it is happening can be hard, because the part of your mind used to analyze is normally focused on the experience itself. **Analyzing your memory of an experience is much easier.** Memory is imperfect, but analyzing a memory is better than nothing. 

The more you remember, the better, so working either with memories of powerful experiences or with fresh memories is best. **It also can be very useful to engage in an experience with the intention of analyzing the memory of it immediately after this can help you remember more details of the experience without interfering with the experience itself.** This does require you to remember that you are going to analyze it without letting that thought interfere with the experience. Tricky!

#### Two Passes

A method that builds on **analyzing memories is to run through your experience twice.** The first time, don't stop to analyze anything — just have the experience. Then, go back and do it again, this time, analyzing everything — maybe even pausing to take notes. **You have the untainted experience fresh in your mind, and the second run through lets you "relive it", but gives you a chance to stop and think, considering how it felt, and why.**

#### Sneak Glances

Is it possible to observe your experience without spoiling it? It is, but it takes some practice. It sounds strange to say this, but **if you "sneak quick glances" at your experience while it is happening, you can often observe it quite well without degrading or interrupting it significantly**. You can learn a lot about an experience with a few short "mental glances". 

What really interrupts train of thought, or train of experience, is interior mental dialog. When you start asking and answering too many questions in your head, your experience is doomed. A "quick glance" is more like: "Exciting enough? Yes". Then, you immediately stop analyzing and get back to the experience, until the next glance.

#### Observe Silently

**Observe what is happening to you while it is happening through continuous observation**. You want it to be as if you were sitting outside yourself, watching yourself, except that you see more than a normal observer. You can hear all of your thoughts and feel all of your feelings. It is almost as if you have **two minds: one moving, engaged in an experience, and one still, silently observing the other**.

This may sound completely bizarre, but it is quite possible and quite useful. It is a difficult state to achieve, but with practice however, you can observe your natural, unconscious without disturbing it. Observing your experiences can be practiced anywhere. 

It will take a great deal of practice. But **if you truly want to listen to yourself, and understand the nature of human experience, you will find the practice worthwhile**.

#### Essential Experience

But how does all this talk about experience and observations really fit in with games? **There is no way I can perfectly replicate the experience but the point is that you don't need to perfectly replicate real experiences to make a good game**. What you need to do is to capture the essence of those experiences for your game. 

**The essence of an experience** are key features that define a memorable experience and make it special. When you go over your memory there are essential and not essential parts. As a **game designer trying to design an experience, your goal is to figure out the essential elements that really define the experience you want to create, and find ways to make them part of your game design**. This way the players of your game
get to experience those essential elements.

The **`key idea here is that the essential experience can often be delivered in a form that is very different from a real experience`**. What are some of the ways you could convey the experience "it was so cold" through a snowball fight game? the characters could breathe little puffs of condensation, and they could have a shivering animation. You could use whistling wind, players can make better snowballs without gloves, but when their hands get too cold, they have to put gloves on. 

Some people find this approach strange, "Just design a game, and see what experience comes out of it!", if you don't know what you want, you might not care what you get. But if you do know what you want — **if you have a vision of how you would like your game to feel to the players — you need to consider how you are going to deliver the essential experience.** And this brings us to our first lens.

## Len #1 - Lens of Essential Experience 

It is true that many designers do not use the Lens of Essential Experience. They just kind of follow their gut instinct, and stumble across game structures that happen to enable experiences that people enjoy. The danger with this approach is that it relies on luck to a large extent. 

To be able to separate the experience from the game is very useful: If you have a **clear picture in your mind of the experiences your players are having, and what parts of your game enable that experience**, you will have a much clearer picture of how to make your game better, because you will know which elements of the game you can safely change, and which ones you cannot. 

**`The ultimate goal of the game designer is to deliver an experience. When you have a clear picture of your ideal experience, and its essential elements, your design has something to aspire to.`** Without that goal you are just wandering in the dark.

## Conclusion - All That's Real Is What You Feel

All this talk of experience brings out an idea that is very strange indeed. **The only reality that we can know is the reality of the experience**. And we know that you need to stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:

* What experience do I want the player to have?
* What is essential to that experience?
* How can my game capture that essence?

**If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change:** You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.

Experience is "not really reality". We filter and the consciousness we actually experience is a kind of illusion. But this illusion is all that can ever be real for us, because it is us. This is a headache for philosophers, but a wonderful thing for game designers, because it means that **the designed experiences that are created through our games have a chance of feeling as real and as meaningful (and sometimes more so) than our everyday experiences**.
