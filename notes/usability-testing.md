## UX Research vs Usability testing

Usability testing is one of the tests that can be done during an UX Research; UX Research not only means with are talking about a broad spectrum but it also means we are refering to a more **scientific approach** to data capture.

### Skills you need

- Qualitative Research Methods
- Quantitative Research Methods
    - Time on task
    - Error rate
    - Industry standard metric
- Developing questions
- Processing results

##### Benefits

Create better products, get to the market quicker, ease of use, stop wasting resources in functionalities that will not be used.

##### Personas

This is the name of **typical end users of your application**, make sure when you look for testers they are as close as you can get to the real user, is usually a good practice to ask your marketing team which are the end user because they will most likely already identified them. 

> Usually a 5 tester group is a good amount

## How to do research

* You must know what questions you want answer to
    * What they dont like about the competitor product
    * How will they like to sign in? via email? username?
* Create a script before interviewing, users usually dont know how to answer your questions, if the question is to broad they probably will accidentally mislead you with the answers
* Dont answer user's questions if they are stuck, you want the experience to be as close as the real experience, the users must be on their own, but you may have to warn the user before hand because during the experiment if they fill ignored the results can change

### How to capture data

The best options are to video capture the screen and the user face if posible, its even better if you can use a document camera to actually know where the user was clicking.

You can bring a few observers from the development teams they might discover other data like long waiting times.

* **Quantitative**: Anything represented by numbers
* **Qualitative**: Things that cant be represented by numbers

### Mistakes during UX Research

* Stress the users with having things like a timer on screen
* Dont take the user feedback for word value, they can be unconsciensly misleading, instead focus on their actions and manerisim 

#### Common bias

* **Hawthorne effect** user behave differently during a test, this is a expected bias to keep in mind
* **Confirmation bias** and **Leading question** We usually encourage user to answer yes or no questions with our prefered answer, and the user will try to give an answer they think will satisfy the interviewer, dont praise or reward the user for any particular answer
> Instead of saying "was this product easy to use" try saying "how difficult or easy was to use? from 1 to 5"
* **Selection bias** If we give a set of instructions the user will try to follow them even if they are hard to do, which will make them repeat actions and create and abnormal situation for the test
> Instead of saying "go to the map" try saying "if we had a map function where will you spect it to be?"
* **Hallo effect or primacy effect**, try to make the first task something really easy to success, this will give a best overall experience (this is biased but the other option is to give the user a bad first experience which will make the overall experience bad)
* **Recency bias** the user will have a better experience with the last used feature, so dont try to ask questions comparing features at the end

### What you should measure

* **Error rate**: How many times a user made an action that was not necessary to reach a certain goal
* **Satisfaction**: Use the NPS System, scale on 0 to 10 to recommend this product to others
* **Completion rate**: How many task was the user able to complete on his own
* **Time on task**: How much time the users take completing each specific task

> Be always careful with the confidence of the measures taken, a result in an small tester group may change radically when the product is released, dont take the answers to face value

### Using the results

* Make sure to note the common feedback between users
* Avoid confusion during task, if two or more task are too similar try to change them up
* If one of the user encounters a problem no one else has try to show this to other participants to see how they will react
* Figure out why the user were surprised, what were they expecting to happen and what happen instead. The goal is for the product to fit the user mental model, make it as intuitive as you possibly can

### Advance methods

* **Remote usability test** are recommended but you need to make sure you can capture the first interaction between the user and the application, they will reduce the cost of usability test and allow us to find more high end users
* Alternate question, quantitative and qualitative, dont focus only on one of them, but give valious feedback
* Avoid privacy leak between the the testers, the opinion of one of them can change the opinion of the others because they might try to align
* You can use non-functional mockups or prototypes during usability test but make sure the users are aware of this
* Use other tools to facilitate feedback for released products like **analytics**, this will allow you to know who your user are, how much time they spend on your site, where are they situated country, are some that even count the amount of clicks made
