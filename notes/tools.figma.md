Its a tool that allows us to do quick prototyping, it allows interactivity and hi-fidelity, it doesn't code the website is a graphic design application

## Why

Figma has most of its tools available on the free version, which means you can go really detailed in a design without investing lost of money, which is important especially when starting

## UI vs UX

UI is what you can see, the template, you can create a UI without using any UX, UI is what you expect.

UX gives us the tools to test, give the application to the user, listen to feedback, understand interaction and usability, we 

## How

Its easy to sit down and start designing with no other resources, but its important to realize, specially if you are working that we are not designing for ourselves, we are designing for the user

### Personas

We can have the information about the personas (our representative users) in sight so when we are making decisions we try and understand what this personas might want and expect

### Task flow

Usually we are not given the task to create a whole new application, but we are focused on a specific task flow 

A task flow is an important or critical feature of our application, its a flow that can be performed on its own and each step is sequential

We can find more information about task and user flows in this [medium article](https://medium.com/erika-harano/ux-task-flows-versus-user-flows-as-demonstrated-by-pancakes-896e78a98026)

We need to make sure what our aim display is, where is our application going to be used from, mobile? pc? both? this will hugely change the way we design

If you have a specific resolution in mind than make sure you are designing in that proportion

## What

When we are starting and building a portfolio its usually hard to think of projects we want to work on, but we can use [random project generator page](https://randomprojectgenerator.com/) when we are stuck
