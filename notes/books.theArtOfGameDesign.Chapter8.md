## Einstein's Violin

At one point in his career, Albert Einstein was asked to give a lecture about his research at a luncheon. When the time came, the host announced that Albert Einstein was here to talk about his theories of special and general relativity. Einstein looking out a largely non-academic audience consisting of mostly old ladies, explained that he certainly could talk about his work, but perhaps they would prefer to hear him play the violin. Einstein proceeded to play several pieces he knew well, creating a delightful experience the entire audience was able to enjoy, and surely one they remembered for the rest of their lives.

Einstein was able to create such a memorable experience because he knew his audience. He knew that physics wasn't something that his audience would be really interested in. They asked him to talk about it, because they thought it would be the best way to get an intimate encounter with the famous Albert Einstein.

**`To create a great experience you must know what your audience will and will not like, and you must know it even better than they do`**. Finding out what people want is not easy, because in many cases, they don't even know. They might think they know, but often there is a big difference between what they think they want, and what it is they will actually enjoy.

**You must learn to listen to your players, thoroughly and deeply. You must become intimate with their thoughts, their emotions, their fears, and their desires**. Some of these will be so secret that your players themselves are not even consciously aware of them — and as we discussed in Chapter 5, it is often these that are the most important.

## Project Yourself

So, how can you do this kind of deep listening? One of the best ways is to use your power of empathy (discussed further in Chapter 9) to put yourself into their place. 

When Disneyland Park was being constructed, Walt Disney would be seen to walk for a distance inspecting the progress, stop, and suddenly crouch to the ground. After seeing him do this repeatedly, some of his designers asked what he was doing, his explanation was simple: how else could he know what Disneyland would look like to children? the perspective of children at Disneyland is just if not more important, than the perspective of adults.

**Physical perspective is not enough — you must adopt their mental perspective as well, actively projecting yourself into the mind of your player**. You must actively try to become them. It is very easy to get stuck in the designer and forget to project yourself into the mind of the player — it requires constant attention and vigilance. If you are creating a game for a target audience that you used to be part of you have an advantage.

People are surprisingly good at forgetting what things were really like when they were younger. As a designer, **you can't afford to forget. Work hard to bring back your old memories, and make them vivid and strong again**. Keep these old memories well oiled — they are some of your most valuable tools.

But what if you are making something for an audience that you have never been a part of, and perhaps never will be. Then you must think hard about people you have known who are in the target demographic, and imagine what it is like to be them. Like a cultural anthropologist. If you can mentally become any type of player, you can greatly expand the audience for your games, because your designs will be able to include people that other designers have ignored.

## Demographics

All individuals are each unique, but **we have to consider ways that groups of people are the same. We call these groups demographics**, or sometimes market segments. There is no "official" means of establishing these groups but for us **the two most significant demographic variables are age and gender**. What follows is an analysis of some of the typical age demographics that a game designer has to consider.

* **0–3 Infant/Toddler**: Children in this age bracket are very interested in toys, the complexity and problem solving involved in games is generally too much.
* **4–6 Preschooler**: First interest in games. Games are very simple, and played with parents rather than other kids, because the parents know how to bend the rules to keep the games enjoyable and interesting.
* **7–9 Kids**: Been called the "age of reason". Generally able to read, think things through, and solve hard problems. Very interested in game playing. Children start making their own decisions about what kinds of toys and games they like and dislike, no longer just accepting whatever their parents choose for them.
* **10–13 Preteen or "Tween"**: Going through a period of tremendous neurological growth, able to think about things more deeply and with more nuance than before. Called the "age of obsession", because kids start to get quite passionate about their interests.
* **13–18 Teen**: Start getting ready for adulthood. Generally see a significant divergence between male and female interests. Boys continue to be interested in competition and mastery, whereas girls become more focused on real-world issues and communication. Boy and girl game interests are very different at this age. Very interested in experimenting with new kinds of experiences, and some of those can happen through gameplay.
* **18–24 Young Adult**: In general, play less than children do. Most adults do continue to play, but without their teenage experiments, they have established certain tastes about the kind of play and entertainment they enjoy. Young adults usually have both time and money on their hands, which makes them big consumers of games.
* **25–35 Twenties and Thirties**: Time starts to become more precious. Age of "peak family formation". As the responsibilities of adulthood start to add up, most adults in this age bracket are only casual game players, playing games as an occasional amusement, or playing games with their young children. On the other hand, "hardcore gamers" are an important target market because they purchase a lot of games, and are often quite vocal about what they do and don't like, potentially influencing the buying decisions of their social network.
* **35–50 Thirties and Forties**: Referred to as the "family maturation" stage, most are very caught up in career and family responsibilities and are only casual game players. Often the ones who make decisions about expensive game purchases (for their kids), and when possible, they look for game playing opportunities the whole family can enjoy together.
* **50 Fifties and Up**: "Empty nesters" suddenly have a lot of time on their hands. Some return to games they enjoyed when younger, and others turn to new game experiences. Adults in this age group are particularly interested in game experiences that have a strong social component, such as golf, tennis, bridge, and online multiplayer games.

These nine groups reflect changes in play patterns. Most of the younger groups are separated by periods of mental development, while the older groups are primarily separated by family transitions.

Something important to remember when creating games for any age group: **all play activities are connected to childhood, since childhood is centered around play**. Therefore, to create games for someone of a particular age, you must be in tune with the games and themes that were popular when they were children. 

> To truly communicate with someone, you must speak the language of their childhood.

### The Medium is the Misogynist?

It becomes clearer as you grow up, males and females are different. What matters is acknowledging and designing for these differences.

The majority of videogames are played by boys and men. Some suggested this is because of the male-oriented aesthetics of these games but experiments to change these aesthetics have failed. There are some deeper driving factor. 

> The core of playing and winning games is mastering abstract formal systems usually enjoyed more by males - Raph Koster - A Theory of Fun

If this is the case then games at their core are an inherently more male than female activity. So why some games are very popular with girl and women? Because **`games contain abstract formal systems at their core, it does not mean that finding and mastering these systems is the only experience that games can create`**. Instead, this core can support a wide variety of experiences that appeal to both genders, such as story, creativity, learning and socialization.

There is no definitive master list of what each gender prefers. The important thing is that you realize that there are some important differences. These are generalizations, certainly not true for every individual, but when making games for large audiences, generalizations are useful.

#### Five Things Males Like to See in Games

> If you are a woman and you don't understand men, chances are you are thinking too hard. – Louis Ramey

1. **Mastery**: Males enjoy mastering things. Regardless if important or useful — it only has to be challenging. Females tend to be more interested in mastery when it has a meaningful purpose.
2. **Competition**: Males really enjoy competing against others to prove that they are the best. For females, the bad feelings often outweigh the positive feelings that come from winning.
3. **Destruction**: Males like destroying things. Videogames allow for virtual destruction of a magnitude far greater than would be possible in the real world.
4. **Spatial Puzzles**: Males generally have stronger skills of spatial reasoning than females. Puzzles that involve navigating 3D spaces are often quite intriguing to males, while they can sometimes prove frustrating for females.
5. **Trial and Error**: Males tend to have a preference for learning things through trial and error. Prefer games that requires some experimentation to understand.

#### Five Things Females Like to See in Games

> Females want experiences where they can make emotional and social discoveries that they can apply to their own lives. – Heidi Dangelmeier

1. **Emotion**: Females like experiences that explore the richness of human emotion. For males, emotion is an interesting component of an experience, but seldom an end in itself.
2. **Real World**: Females tend to prefer entertainment that connects meaningfully to the real world either through the gameplay or the social aspects. Males will more frequently take on the role of fantasy characters.
3. **Nurturing**. Females enjoy nurturing. Taking care of others. Common to see girls sacrifice a winning position in a competitive game to help a weaker player, partly because the relationships and feelings of the players are more important than the game, but partly out of the joy of nurturing.
4. **Dialog and Verbal Puzzles**: Females have increased verbal skills. Women purchase many more books than men do, and the audience for crossword puzzles is mostly female.
5. **Learning by Example**: Females tend to prefer learning by example. They have a strong appreciation for clear tutorials that lead you carefully, step-by-step, so that when it is time to attempt a task, the player knows what she is supposed to do. 

You must **look closely at your game to determine its strengths and weaknesses on a gender basis**. Sometimes this leads to fascinating discoveries. The designers of Hasbro's Pox, found girls almost never play games spontaneously in large groups. 

The problem seems to lie in conflict resolution. When boys play a game, and there is a dispute, play stops, there is a discussion, and the dispute is resolved. But when a group of girls play a game, and there is a dispute, it is a different story. Most of the girls will take sides on the dispute, and it generally cannot be resolved right away. Play stops, and often cannot continue.  **Informal competing teams puts too much stress on girls personal relationships to be worth the trouble**

In the past, most games were very social. The introduction of affordable computers gave us a type of game that:

* Had all social aspects removed
* Had most verbal and emotional aspects removed
* Was largely divorced from the real world
* Was generally hard to learn
* And offered the possibility for unlimited virtual destruction

Whether you consider age, gender, or other factors, **the important thing is that you put yourself in the perspective of the player, so you can carefully consider what will make the game the most fun for them**. This important perspective is Lens #16.

## Lens #16: The Lens of the Player

To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about your player. Ask yourself these questions about the people who will play your game:

* In general, what do they like?
* What don't they like? Why?
* What do they expect to see in a game?
* If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?
* What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?

A good game designer should always be thinking and advocating for the player. Skilled designers hold The Player and Holographic Design Lenses in the same hand, thinking about the player, the experience of the game, and the mechanics of the game all at the same time. **Thinking about the player is useful, but even more useful is watching them play your game**. The more you observe them playing, the more easily you'll be able to predict what they are going to enjoy.

When developing Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold for DisneyQuest, we had to consider a wide range of demographics: families. Further, DisneyQuest's goal is to get the whole family playing games together. Roughly, we broke it down this way:

* **Boys**: We had little worry that boys would enjoy playing this game. "Adventure and battle fantasy" where players can pilot a pirate ship, and man powerful cannons. Boys tended to play offensively, destroying every pirate ship they could find. They engaged in some communication, but always stayed focused on destroying the enemy.
* **Girls**: We were not so confident that girls would like this game. Tended to play more defensively, concerned about protecting their ship from invaders. Excited about the treasures you could gather, so we pile them up conspicuously on the deck. We designed flying skeletons would charge the ship and snatch the treasures off of the deck. This made the skeleton shooting task much more important and rewarding to the girls. Enjoy the social aspects of the game, they would constantly shout warnings and suggestions.
* **Men**: "Tall boys with credit cards". They seemed to like the game in the same ways the boys did, but played in a slightly more reserved way puzzling out the optimal way to play the game.
* **Women**: We had very little confidence that women. Mothers  main concern is not how much fun they personally have, but how much fun the rest of the family has. Tended to gravitate toward the back of the ship, this meant that mom steered the ship. Since mom wants to see everyone have a good time, she suddenly has a vested interest in steering the ship as well as possible. Being at the helm, which has the best view, she has a chance to keep an eye on everyone, to steer the ship to interesting places, and to slow things down if her family is overwhelmed. Further, she is in a good position to manage her crew, warning them of oncoming dangers, and giving orders designed to make sure everyone has fun. Accepting the fact that women would be steering the ship more often meant steering the ship was required to be easy for someone who was not a frequent videogame player.

## Psychographics

**Demographics generally refer to external factors** (age, gender, income, ethnicity, etc.), when we group people, we are trying to get at something internal: what each group finds pleasurable. A more direct approach is to **focus on how they think on the inside. This is called psychographics**. Some psychographic breakdowns have to do with "lifestyle" choices (dog lover, baseball fan, etc.)

Some psychographics are tied to concrete activities. But other kinds of psychographics **have more to do with what a person enjoys the most, the kind of pleasures they look for when participating in a game activity, or really, any activity**. The motivation for every human action can be traced back to some kind of pleasure seeking. Though **there are many kinds of pleasures in the world, and no one seeks only one kind. But it is certainly true that people have their pleasure preferences**. Game designer Marc LeBlanc has proposed a list of eight pleasures that he considers the primary "game pleasures".

### LeBlanc's Taxonomy of Game Pleasures

1. **Sensation**: Pleasures of sensation involve using your senses. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling or tasting. **It is primarily the aesthetics of your game that will deliver these pleasures**. Sensory pleasure is often the pleasure of Lens #15. This **cannot make a bad game into a good one, but it can often make a good game into a better one**.
2. **Fantasy**. This is the pleasure of **the imaginary world, and the pleasure of imagining yourself as something that you are not**. We will discuss this pleasure further in Chapters 17 and 18.
3. **Narrative**: **Pleasure of a dramatic unfolding of a sequence of events, however it happens**. We'll be talking more about this in Chapters 14 and 15.
4. **Challenge**: Can be considered one of the core pleasures of gameplay, **every game has a problem to be solved**. For some players, this pleasure is enough — but others need more.
5. **Fellowship**: **Enjoyable about friendship, cooperation, and community**. For some players, this is the main attraction of playing games. We will discuss this further in Chapters 21 and 22.
6. **Discovery**: **Any time you seek and find something new, that is a discovery**. Sometimes this is the exploration of your game world, and sometimes it is the discovery of a secret feature or clever strategy. Discovering new things is a key game pleasure.
7. **Expression**: This is the pleasure of **expressing yourself and the pleasure of creating things**. Allow players to design their own characters, and build and share their own levels. Often expression does little to achieve the goals of the game but for some players, it may be the very reason they play.
8. **Submission**: This is the pleasure of **entering the magic circle — of leaving the real world behind, and entering into a new, more enjoyable, set of rules and meaning**. In some games, you are forced to suspend your disbelief — in others, the game itself seems to suspend your disbelief effortlessly, and your mind easily enters and stays in the game world. It is these games that make submission truly a pleasure.

Game designer Richard Bartle, has observed that players fall into four main groups in terms of their game pleasure preferences. They have the suits of playing cards as a convenient mnemonic, try to understand why each card suit was chosen to represent each category.

### Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types

1. ♦ Achievers: Want to achieve the goals of the game. Primary pleasure is Challenge.
2. ♠ Explorers: Want to get to know the breadth of the game. Primary pleasure is Discovery.
3. ♥ Socializers: Want relationships with other people. Primary pleasure is Fellowship.
4. ♣ Killers: Want to compete with and defeat others. Enjoy a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction.

Bartle also proposes a fascinating graph (Figure 8.4) that shows how the four types neatly cover a sort of space: 

* Achievers are interested in acting on the world
* Explorers are interested in interacting with the world
* Socializers are interested in interacting with players
* Killers are interested in acting on players.

We must use caution when trying to make such simple taxonomies describe something as complex as human desire. Both LeBlanc's and Bartle's taxonomies have gaps, and when misused can gloss over subtle pleasures such as "destruction" and "nurturing". Below is a list of a few more pleasures to be considered.

* **Anticipation**: When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind of pleasure.
* **Delight in Another's Misfortune**: Typically, we feel this when some unjust person suddenly gets their comeuppance. It is an important aspect of competitive games.
* **Gift Giving**: There is a unique pleasure when you make someone else happy through the surprise of a gift. The pleasure is not just that the person is happy, but that you made them happy.
* **Humor**: Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to make a barking noise.
* **Possibility**: This is the pleasure of having many choices and knowing you could pick any one of them.
* **Pride in an Accomplishment**: This is a pleasure all its own that can persist long after the accomplishment was made.
* **Purification**: It feels good to make something clean. Many games take advantage of the pleasure of purification.
* **Surprise**: Surprise shows us, the brain likes surprises (Lens #2).
* **Thrill**: "Fear minus death equals fun". Thrill is that kind of fun — you experience terror, but feel secure in your safety.
* **Triumph over Adversity**: This is that pleasure that you have accomplished something that you knew was a long shot. Typically this pleasure is accompanied by shouts of personal triumph.
* **Wonder**: An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement.

Lists of pleasures can serve as convenient rules of thumb, but don't forget to keep an open mind for ones that might not be on your list. The crucial perspective of pleasure gives us Lens #17.

## Lens #17: The Lens of Pleasure

To use this lens, think about the kinds of pleasure your game does and does not provide. Ask yourself these questions:

* What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?
* What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?

Ultimately, the job of a game is to give pleasure. By going through lists of known pleasures, and considering how well your game delivers each one, you may be inspired to make changes to your game that will increase your players enjoyment. Always be on the lookout, though, for unique, unclassified pleasures not found in most games — for one of these might be what gives your game the unique quality it needs.

Knowing your players intimately, more intimately than they know themselves, is the key to giving them a game they will enjoy. In Chapter 9, we will get to know them even better.
