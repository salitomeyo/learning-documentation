It a way to fidelize our customers, we need to create and identity, we are building a brand, the loyalty of customers is what we aim for

## Colors

When we are creating an application we need to give our users something to recognize us with, one of the easiest ways to do this is to have a color palette followed throughout our application and all our products

This helps us be easily recognized

### Primary colors
Usually includes the most common 6 colors in our application, including 

* Primary action color
* Secondary action color
* Primary type color (font color)
* 2 backgroung colors
* One extra accent color

### Secondary colors
Includes all other colors that will be used in our application but in a smaller ratio than our primary colors, including

* Hover variation of our primary action color
* Hover variation of our secondary action color
* Status colors to represent errors, success, warnings
* All other used colors

## Typhography

All the fonts used in our application and what will they be used and their sizes. Including:

* Headings font (for each of the headlines form h1 to h6)
* Regular font (for each type of paragraph, regular text, placeholders)
* Numbers font (only if needed)
