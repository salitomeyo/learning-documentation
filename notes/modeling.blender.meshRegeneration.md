One of the things we can use to avoid using deformated meshes is usign transformed cubes or rounded cubes instead of spheres 

One of the sculpt brushes that causes more mesh deformation are the pinch , elastic deform and grab

## Dyntopo

We use it with the **Clean Strip** brush

We can activate it in the brush menu, the detail size will be the size of the subdivisions

> it can be set to relative or constant detail

### Relative detail

The smaller the detail size the more subdivisions it will create, it takes into account the amount of zoom

### Constant detail

The bigger the size the more subdivisions it will create, it doesnt take the zoom into account so its more reliable

## Remesh

Is not compatible with dyntopo, you can only use one of them at the time

We can find it in the to right part of the screen, it remeshes the entire object which can be overkilled for big projects like a full body model
