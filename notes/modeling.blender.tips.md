We have a lot of useful tips that can make the user experience in blender a lot better, but this are optional and are meant to be acommodated to the user so please take this as light recommendation but modify as you please

## Workspace

This are the different windows we see on the top menu, they are reserved to the default ones but we can create more or modify the default ones as we please

### Creating a new workspace

1. Right-Click on any of the workspaces and duplicate
2. Double click the name and accommodate it to what will be inside of the workspace
3. Right-Click your new workspace and reorder it to the back in order to dont disturb the default worskpace location
4. Enter your new worskpace

### Modifying your workspace

* **Creating multiple areas**: Go to the top right corner of the partition and when you see the `+` drag to create another one
* **Changing the editor type**: On any partition of the current workspace we will see a drop down on the top left corner, we can use this to select any editor type between generalÃ±,a nimation, editing and data
* **Eliminating areas**: Right-Click on the top of the area and choose close area, this will completely eliminate the partition
* **Spliting areas**: Right-Click on the top of the area and choose to split either vertical or horizontal, thiws will plit the area in two duplicates of the one splitted but with the sizes the partition was made on

### Saving our workspaces to the blender environment

Once you have changed any workspace and we want to save this configurations to our blender (So that anytime we open it it reloads ours workspaces just as you left them) we have to save a startup

> File > Defaults > Save startup File

## Shortcuts

We can pin any tool, menu, or other to the window using

* **Shift + Left-Click**: Inside the window or tool we want to pin in a window
* **Shift + Left-Click + drag**: In the corner of an area will create a new window for the area separated from all the blender, a pop up
* **Ctrl + Left-Click + drag**: In the corner of an area will allow us to switch area positions
* **Ctrl + Space**: While hovering an area to turn it into full screen
