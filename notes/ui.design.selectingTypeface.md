## Inspiration

We need to figure out what a typeface is communicating, when to use it, its okay to [get inspired by others](https://www.designspiration.com/) art unrelated to the medium, just have a feel to what others are doing 

When you are reviewing others art and mediums **try to figure out what it makes you feel and compare pieces trying to figure out why** it makes you feel that way and how you can incorporate those characteristics to your designs

You can also get more specific for your information like [where different fonts are beign used](https://fontsinuse.com/), and other inspiration galeries

* [TypeWolf](https://www.typewolf.com/) - whats trending in type and informative articles about fonts
* [Typespiration](https://typespiration.com/) - Font and color palettes combinations that you can use
* [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/) - gives you recommendations of fonts that work together

## Define the Brand Personality

Before being able to design you have to **establish what your brand means, what it stands for and what it should communicate**

The most commonly used technique is brainstorming all the adjetives you think communicate the brand, combine the words that have a similar meaning into the one you think represents your brand best and between the remaining options pick the 5 adjetives you think best describe the personality of the brand

Instead of focusing on the aesthetic beauty we can **have conversations that  focus on wheter the aesthetic communicates the brand's personality**

## Font Shops

Some of the fonts we will like to use are not free to use, we need to **figure out what kind of license we need if any before using a font**

First be aware that there are plenty of free fonts you can choose from, some of the more common are the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Creative cloud users can also find lots of fonts available in [Adobe fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)

Or you can purchase different fonts in sites like [Branding with Type](https://brandingwithtype.com/) and [Typography](https://www.typography.com/) but be aware of the different kind of licenses before buying cause not all licenses cover all uses

And finally you can use other services like [Prototypo](https://devvv.prototypo.io/) to easily customize fonts to your particular needs

## Body Text

If 90% of our web is typography we can assume **almost 85% of our web is body typography**, which means its really important and is usually choosen first before choosing title typography

There is a few characteristics that we need to fullfill in order to choose a body typography

* **Should be simple** not necessarily bland but subtle personality
* **Should be readable even on really small sizes** which means probably closer to a sans-serif with no decorations
* **Should be easy to read** so have a bigger than normal x-height which means the lowercase letters should be large compared to the overall size
* **Shouldn't have too much contrast** which means the line weight difference should be too large between thin and thick strokes 
* **Should have different styles like bolded and stricked** according to our needs

## Single Typefaces

Some **designs could get away with using a single typeface**, but it could difficult the hierarchy given when using different fonts

Some fonts take this into account and create multiple versions of the same typeface to target different uses

Its up to you as a designer to decide what works best for your needs 

## Display Text

Is the **heading typography is much more concern with drawing attention and being interesting than with being readable**

We need to be able to communicate most of the brand personality with our display text, set the tone, it needs to draw people in and want to read it

Some of the common characteristics for display text are

* **Should have personality** it should be able to express our brand personality just by its looks
* **Should be aim for bigger size** it should have enough details to appear interesting even on bigger size
* **Should draw people in** it should be eye catching

## Meta Information

This is **information that is somewhat non important to the readers** and should kind of merge in the background to avoid distracting the user, like captions or dates

Its usually used in content heavy websites like a news website so not all websites need an extra typeface but it can be used if necessary

We want to **make it obvious that it is last in the hierarchy, its usually smaller and uncomfortable to read, lighther** than the usual text font color, we want the information to be there but avoid breaking the readability 

## Font Pairing

Most of the time we are going to have more than one typeface, there are some "rules" we can follow but in reality you need to train your eyes

When choosing a font in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) you can scroll to the bottom and it will suggest popular pairings

Some of the things you can review to know if fonts are a good match

* The **typefaces are not too similar, they dont clash**, we want them too look obviously different
* The **typefaces are not complete opposites**, they are different but also balanced:
    * The x-height is really similar
    * Stroke weight is quite similar
    * The overall shape of the letters is similar
* The **typefaces display an average amount of personality** if one of the typefaces has too much personality the other one should be quite conservative, they need to average each other

We can use [TypeConnection game](http://www.typeconnection.com/) to train your brain to find pairing typefaces

You can train by creating small introduction pages that show the personality of artist, brands, art through the fonts, if you can think of any use [Wiki Roulette](https://wikiroulette.co/) to inspire yourself
