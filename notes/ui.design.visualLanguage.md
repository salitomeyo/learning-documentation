## Photography

If you dont have good photos or access to a professional photographer its okay to just dont use photos

With the cropped style of our photos we can make them feel aligned

We can also add an undertone to make different pictures feel unified

We dont want pictures that have too much, this will built and element of chaos we dont want

## Shapes

Each shape can have thousands of variants, and there are thousands of shapes, how do we decide which shape and which variant?

**The starting point should be our typeface, make sure you use shapes that work well with the typeface**

Take into account the line weight, shape and angles present in our choosen typeface, and also take into account you probably want some contrast, specially if there are not much other elements of contrast

## Illustrations

Remember **colors in our illustrations dont have to be realistic**, just get the values right

We can create illustrations that are only patterns of shapes, but if you do this make sure this kind of ilustration contains some sort of visual interest

You can also use **hand drawn illustrations, this are usually great because they break the visual monotony**, specially on really overused typographies or simple designs

If our design is too boring you can create a wild and chaotic pattern to balance contrast and conformity

## Textures

If we choose a typeface with no personality we can consider **using textures to create a unique personality**

We can add some interest to buttons creating gradients or patterns

You have to also make sure you are **creating the visual interest in places you want to draw the users attention to**, dont use texture on unimportant backgrounds

Texture can create a unique identity so you can find a texture and use it in different parts of the app like all the illustrations to **create a belonging feeling**

## Patterns

Is slighly different to a texture because **is something that repeats over an area**

You can use simple repeating patterns specially if the design is already complex enough because **distracting patterns can make the design too busy**

We usually **make patterns way more subtle than textures**

## Gradients

Can be a **very easy way to create a visual language**, when we create a gradient we can make **unique feelings even if our company colors are the same as other companies**

If we use really simple typefaces we can have more fun with our gradients

**Gradients should never be between contrasting colors** because the middle color will be gray, to avoid this either use colors closer together in the color wheel or create a contrast with more than two stops to avoid the gray

Our gradients should be kind of subtle and avoid using too many colors

## Icons

**Icons can have all the personality of a logo while summarizing what something means in a single symbol**

Which means icons are really easy for users to identify and they transcent languages

Creating your own icon set can be really hard, you need to make them consistent while also identifiable

Is better to **make the icons feel like part of the typography**, specially the typography used next to this icons

Icons set usually include some crazy amount of icons but this is usually overkill so just **pick a subset of those icons to use consistently** on the application

Some icons are universally acceptable so make sure you respect those universal meanings, **dont try to change the standard**, just modify the icon to ajust to your typeface patterns

Also create rules about the sizing and colors, very simplistic icons are better on smaller sizes while very complex icons are better on bigger sizes so have restrictions that respect this standards, you can have a small and large version of the icon if needed instead of using the same icon
