Its a guideline of questions that you will take with you as you do research and interview people

## Goal

The goal is to go out and gather insights about the targeted people, identify and explore their behaviours, shine light on the unknown. 

While we're doing that we're looking for patterns of information that help us validate or invalidate our problems and solution assumptions

## Script Template

To create the script its important to keep the persona next to you, it usually takes about 3 to 4 pages and it's printed and given to the interviewee

Here you can find an
[[Script Template|assets/documents/The_Interview_Script.pdf]] you can use for other purposes, in this case its filled out with examples of a Persona of a boba tea shop

### Recluiting questions

Are the questions you make before hand in order to identify if someone is your persona or not, if someone does not make part of your persona then it doesn't make sense to make any further questions

### Learning goals

Are high level areas we want to learn more about, this section is just for your own reference, its not necesary to share this with the people you want to interview

### Introduction

We have to introduce ourselves to the interviewee and ask permision to record the session, make sure the information is clear, state how long the interview will take, whats the goal, let them know there is not wrong answers

### Questions

#### Icebreaker

Its important to set the mood of the interview with a first lighthearted question, it has nothing to do with the interview

#### About them

Learn a little bit about the person, nothing to personal 

#### Learning goal topic

We should have al the questions we require to understand all our learning goals

#### Wish list

Based on everything we talk if i give you a magic wand to solve your problems what is your wish?

## Notes

* In the start we want to make questions more open ended, not too specific

### Spark conversations around

* Scenarios/activities
* Real world context
* Pains and joys
* First time, last time
* Best time, worst time
* Wish list

### Conversation prompts

We can ask questions in order to spark a conversation or to ask more details about a certain topic

* Have you ever had an experience where ...?
* Can you tell me the story from beginning to end?
* Then what happen?
* How did you do that?
* What did you love or hate about it?

### Do

* Smile
* Ask open ended questions
* Get their story
* Be quiet and listen
* Ask how, why, what?

### Don't

* Talk about your product
* Talk the entire time
* Ask leading questions
* Ask about future behaviours
* Ask "do you like it/would you use it?"
* Sell
* Lots of yes/no questions

### Deep dive

Dont cut the interviewee when they enter the topic you are aiming to learn, get the story first, then dive in the certain part you want to know more about

## HOW - 2 Person dynamic

if you are the only interviewer dont write anything down during the interview 

1. Record the session, at least the audio, ask questions
2. Listen back to the recording
3. Write every insight, quote, learnings or anything helpful on sticky notes, one per sticky note
4. Write the name of the interviewee on one of the sticky notes, each interviewee will have one sticky note color

## HOW - 3 Person dynamic

If there are 2 interviewers, they will both take different roles

### Note taker

1. Dont take
2. Take notes

### Interviewer 

Will do the same as the interviewer in the 2 person dynamic while on the interview

### Both

As soon as the interview ends both will create sticky notes with every insight found, following the one color per interviewee color code
