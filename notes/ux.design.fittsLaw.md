Provides a model of human movement which can accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target, (established in 1954, although originally developed according to movement in the physical world) in human-computer interaction is applied to movement through the graphical user interface. 

Fitts's Law predictions are consistent across the many different mathematical representations.

Fitts law states `the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target`

## Applying Fitts law to user interface design

1. **Interactive elements**: Must be distinguished from other non-interactive elements
2. **The outer edges and corners**: Can be acquired wirh grater speed than anywhere else in the display due to the ponning action of the screen the user is restricted to move anyfurther than the outermost points of the screen
3. **Pop-up menus**: Better suppor immediate selection fo interactive elements than dropdown menus as the user does not have to move the cursor from its current position
4. **Selecting options**: Within linear menus takes longer than clicking options in pie menus, in pie menus traveling distance is the same for all the options
5. **Task bars**: Impide movement through the interface as they require more time-consuming level of precision than options placed on the oute limits of the screen

## Simple rule

We aim to `reduce the travel distance` from one point to the next and make the target large enough to enable prompt detection and selection without sacrificing accuracy

Its important to `design according to user expectations`, they should be able to click anywhere within the clearly defined boundaries
