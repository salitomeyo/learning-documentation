Contrary to popular believe testing is not a waste of time, testing allows us to deliver better quality applications and take into account changes during development to ensure easy feedback

## Types of testing

En reality there are a lot of different possible tests that can be made, in this notes i will try to explain to the best of my ability the ones i have learned

>Note: remember that the experts recommend to keep unit testing as at least the 70% of the tests done in any software
