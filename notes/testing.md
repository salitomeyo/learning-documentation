Contrary to popular believe testing is not a waste of time, testing allows us to deliver better quality applications and take into account changes during development to ensure easy feedback

## Types of testing

En reality there are a lot of different possible tests that can be made, in this notes i will try to explain to the best of my ability the ones i have learned

>Note: remember that the experts recommend to keep unit testing as at least the 70% of the tests done in any software

## Test scenario

Is defined as any functionality that can be tested, its also called Test Condition or Test Possibility.

### How to create a test scenario

1. Carefully study the requirement document, it could be any of the following

    * Business Requirement Specification (BRS)
    * Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
    * Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)

2. Isolate every requirement, and identify what possible user actions need to be tested for it. Figure the technical issues associeted with the requirement, analize and frame possible system abuse scenarios by evaluation the software with a hackers's eye

3. Enumerate test scenarios that cover every possible feature of the software. Ensure these cover every user flow and business flow involved in the operation of the website or app

4. After listing the test scenarios create a Traceability matrix to ensure that every requirement is mapped to a test scenario

5. Get the scenarios reviewed by a supervisor, and then push them to be reviewed by other stakeholders involved in the project
