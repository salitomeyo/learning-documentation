Hopefully, this book will inspire you to try designing some games of your own. You might be thinking that you aren't going about it the right way, not using the methods that "real" game designers use. I'm guessing the method you used to design your games was something like

1. Think of an idea.
2. Try it out.
3. Keep changing it and testing it until it seems good enough.

Which sounds kind of amateurish. But that is exactly what real game designers do. And this chapter would end here, except for the fact that some ways to do these are better than others. You already know what to do. In this chapter and the next, we are going to discuss how to do it as well as possible.

## Inspiration

You can learn from other but you will never stand out

> The secret is: don't look to other jugglers for inspiration, look everywhere else.

These guys can copy my moves, but they can't copy my inspiration.

## Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration

> When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru. – Ram Dass

To you use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games like it. Instead, look everywhere else.

Ask yourself these questions:

* What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?
* In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?

## Inspiration 

Inspiration is one of the secrets behind the strongest games. But how can you turn inspiration into a great game design? The first step is admitting you have a problem.

### State the Problem

The purpose of design is to solve problems, and game design is no exception. Before you start coming up with ideas, you need to be certain of why you are doing it, and a problem statement is a way to state that clearly. **Good problem statements tell both your goal and your constraints**. 

For example, your initial problem statement might be: "How can I make a Web-based game that teenagers will really like?" This makes clear both your goal (something teenagers will really like) and your
constraints (it must be a Web-based game). **One advantage of stating things so clearly is that it can make you realize that you might be mistakenly over constraining the real problem**. 

Maybe you've been thinking "Web-based game", but really, there is no reason that what you create has to be a game at all — maybe some kind of Web-based toy or activity would be okay as long as teenagers really like it. So, you might restate your problem in broader terms: "How can I make a Web-based experience that teenagers really like?".

It is **crucial to get the problem statement right** — if you make it too broad, you might come up with designs that don't meet your true goal, and if you make it too narrow you might create a solution but ignore all other possible solutions.

Using this lens **requires an open mind and a big imagination. You need to search you feelings and observe everything around you. You must be willing to try the impossible** — for surely it is impossible for a roll of the dice to capture the excitement of a swordfight, or for a videogame to make a player feel afraid of the dark — isn't it? Use this lens to **find the non-game experiences that will inspire your game**. 

Your choices in the different quadrants of the tetrad (technology, mechanics, story, and aesthetics) can each be united by a single inspiration, or each can build on different inspirations, blending them together to create something entirely new. When you have concrete visions based on real life that guide your decision making, your experience will acquire an undeniable power, strength, and uniqueness.

This lens works hand in hand with Lens #1: Essential Experience. Use the Lens of Infinite Inspiration to seek and find beautiful experiences, and the Lens of Essential Experience to bring them into your game.

People who come up with clever solutions are almost always the same people who take the time to figure out the real problem. Three advantages of clearly stating your problem:

1. **Broader creative space**. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.
2. **Clear measurement**. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed ideas: How well do they solve the problem?
3. **Better communication**. When you are designing with a team, communication is much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has not been clearly stated.

Sometimes, you will have already explored several ideas before you realize what the problem "really" is. That's fine! Just make sure you go back and restate the problem clearly, once you see what it is. 

A completed game design will cover all four elements of the elemental tetrad: technology, mechanics, story, and aesthetics. Often, your problem statement will constrain you to some established decisions about one (or more) of the four elements, and you will have to build from there. As you **try to state your problem, it can be useful to examine it from the point of view of the tetrad to check where you have design freedom, and where you don't**. 

Take a look at these four problem statements: Which ones have already made decisions in what parts of the tetrad?

1. How can I make a board game that uses the properties of magnets in an interesting way?
2. How can I make a videogame that tells the story of Hansel and Gretel?
3. How can I make a game that feels like a surrealist painting?
4. How can I improve on Tetris?

What if, by some miracle, you have no constraints? If that is the case you need to decide some constraints. Pick a story you might like to pursue or a game mechanic you would like to explore. The moment you pick something, you will have a problem statement. Viewing your game as the solution to a problem is a useful perspective and Lens #12.

### How to Sleep

We have stated our problem and are ready to brainstorm! Once we have properly prepared. Sleep is crucial to the process of idea generation — a good designer uses the tremendous power of sleep to its maximum advantage. 

No one explains this better, I think, than surrealist painter Salvador Dali. The following
(Dali's Secret #3) is an excerpt from his book Fifty Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship. 

In order to make use of the slumber with a key seat in an armchair, with your head tilted back and resting on the back. Your two hands must hang beyond the arms of the chair... you must hold a heavy key which you will keep suspended, delicately pressed between the extremities of the thumb and forefinger of your left hand. Under the key you will previously have placed a plate upside down on the floor. Having made these preparations, you will have merely to let yourself be progressively invaded by a sense of serene afternoon sleep, like the spiritual drop of anisette. The moment the key drops from your fingers, its fall will awaken you, and you may be equally sure that **this fugitive moment during which you cannot be assured of having really slept is totally sufficient, inasmuch as not a second more is needed for your whole physical and psychic being to be revivified by just the necessary amount of repose**.

---

## Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement

To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem. Ask yourself these questions:

* What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
* Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
* Is a game really the best solution? Why?
* How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

---

Defining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.

### Your Silent Partner

Is Dali crazy? The benefits of a good night's sleep are easy to believe — but what possible benefit could there be in a nap that lasts only a fraction of a second? **Most of our good, clever, creative ideas are not arrived at through a process of logical, reasoned argument**.

No, the really good ideas just seem to pop up out of nowhere; **the subconscious is a source of tremendous, and possibly all, creative power**. Consider our dreams. Your subconscious has been creating these fascinating little comedies and dramas, each one different, three shows nightly, since before you were born.

Far from a sequence of random images, **most people frequently have dreams that are quite meaningful**. There are many known instances of important problems solved in dreams. 

One is the story of the chemist Friedrich Von Kekule over the structure of benzene (C6H6). My mind's eye, sharpened by many previous experiences, distinguished larger structures of diverse forms, long series, closely joined together; all in motion, turning and twisting like serpents. Upon awakening, he knew that benzene's structure was a ring shape. Now, would you say the Kekule himself thought of the solution? It was as if the author of the dreams had solved the problem and was merely presenting it to Kekule.

**Who is the author of these dreams? On one level, the subconscious mind is part of us, but on another, it seems to be quite separate**. The idea of regarding one's subconscious mind as another person sounds kind of crazy. But creativity is crazy. Why not treat it like a separate entity? **`Treating your subconscious like another person can give us a well-understood model for thinking about and interacting with them`**. 

Creative minds have been doing it for thousands of years. Stephen King describes his silent partner in his book On Writing: There is a muse, but he's not going to come fluttering down and scatter creative fairy-dust all over. You have to do all the grunt labor, while the muse sits, smokes cigars and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? He may not be much of a conversationalist but **he's got the inspiration, a bag of magic. There's stuff in there that can change your life. Believe me, I know**. 

If we pretend our creative subconscious is another person, what is that person like? Here are some common characteristics of the creative subconscious that most people seem to share:

* **Can't talk, or at least chooses not to**. Not in words, anyway. Tends to communicate through imagery and emotions.
* **Impulsive**. Tends not to plan ahead, tends to live in the moment.
* **Emotional**. Gets swept up in whatever you are feeling — happy, angry, excited, afraid — the subconscious seems to feel things more deeply and more powerfully than the conscious mind.
* **Playful**. It has a constant curiosity, and loves wordplay and pranks.
* **Irrational**. Not bound by logic and rationality, the subconscious comes up with ideas that often make no sense. Need to go to the moon? Perhaps a long ladder will work. Sometimes these ideas are a useless distraction, but sometimes they are the clever perspective you have sought all along.

I sometimes wonder if the long-term appeal of the character of Harpo Marx, from the Marx Brothers films has to do with the fact that he matches the profile of the creative subconscious almost perfectly. Harpo doesn't speak, is impulsive, is very emotional, is always playful, and is certainly irrational. However, his crazy solutions to problems often save the day, and in quiet moments, he plays music of angelic beauty — not for the praise of others, but simply for the joy of doing it. I like to think of Harpo as the patron saint of the creative subconscious.

Sometimes, though, **working with the creative subconscious can feel like you have a deranged four-year-old living inside your head. Without the rational mind to plan things out, take precautions, and set things straight, this guy would never survive on his own**. For this, many people get in the habit of ignoring it's suggestions. But keep in mind that he has been creating entertaining virtual worlds for you each night, since before you were born, and he is more in touch with the essence of experience than you can ever hope to be. Here are some tips for getting the most out of this unusual creative partnership.

#### Subconscious Tip #1: Pay Attention

Listening, this time to your self (sort of). The subconscious is no different: If you ignore it, it is will stop making suggestions. If you get in the habit of listening, seriously considering its ideas, and thanking it when you get a good one, it will start to offer more and better suggestions.

So, how do you listen to something that can't talk? What you must do is **pay closer attention to your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions, and your dreams, for those are the ways the subconscious communicates**. The more you pay attention to what the subconscious has to say, the more work it will do for you.

For example, say you are brainstorming ideas for a surfing game. Suddenly, you have this inkling of an idea: "What if the surfboards were bananas?" which is crazy, of course. Now, you could say to yourself, "That's stupid" Or, you could take a few moments, and seriously consider the idea and then another thought comes: "With monkeys surfing on them". And suddenly, this doesn't seem so dumb **maybe this game could be something different, something new, something that might gain you a wider audience than the more realistic game you had originally planned**. 

Even if you ultimately reject the idea, your subconscious might feel a little more respected and take part more seriously in the brainstorming process because of the time you spent considering suggestions — and what did it cost you? Only a few seconds of quiet reflection.

#### Subconscious Tip #2: Record Your Ideas

You will record your ideas during a brainstorming session but record them all the time. By recording all of your ideas you'll have a record of many ideas that you would likely have forgotten otherwise, and second, you'll free up your mind to think of other things. 

When you think of an important idea, and you don't write it down, it kind of bangs around up there, taking up space and mental energy, because your mind recognizes it as important and doesn't want to forget the important idea. When you **record your ideas you'll find it makes my mind feel clean and open, as opposed to cluttered and cramped. It leaves the freedom to think seriously about the design of the day, without tripping over the clutter of important unrecorded ideas**.

#### Subconscious Tip #3: Manage Its Appetites (Judiciously)


The subconscious mind has appetites, some of which are primal. These appetites seem to be part of its job — just as it is the rational mind's job to determine which appetites can be safely fed, and how to go about doing that. If the subconscious mind feels one of these appetites too strongly, it will obsess about it. When it is obsessing, it can't do good creative work because these intrusive thoughts will distract you.

Maslow's hierarchy, which we'll discuss in Chapter 9, is a pretty good guide here — **if you don't have food, safety, and healthy personal relationships, it will be hard to do self-actualizing creative work. Make it a priority to get these things worked out**, and come up with compromises that will keep your subconscious satisfied so it can spend its time coming up with genius ideas. Use good judgment, of course — some appetites are dangerous and should be curbed, not fed.

#### Subconscious Tip #4: Sleep

Sleep is crucial, and not just the slumber with a key. Sleep is primarily for the benefit of the mind. Some strange process of **sorting, filing, and reorganizing seems to be going on when we sleep**. Clearly, the subconscious is wide awake and active for at least a part of the sleep cycle — the part that features dreams.

It feels like he (the subconscious) takes naps when i haven't had enough sleep, or at least he isn't participating much in what I'm doing, and this absence shows in my work. And following a feeling of him "showing up" a flood of useful ideas came forth.

#### Subconscious Tip #5: Don't Push Too Hard

Did you ever try to think of a word during a conversation and you know you know it, but just can't think of it? So you try and force the answer out of your mind — but it just doesn't come. So, you give up and move on. A few minutes later, suddenly the answer pops into your mind. It is as if **the subconscious was working on the problem of finding the answer in the background and when it found the answer, it gave it to you. No amount of concentration or straining was going to move it along faster**; in fact, this seems to slow the process down.

**Don't expect immediate answers from your subconscious. Give it a problem to solve, make clear the problem is important, and leave it to do its work**. The answer might come quickly, it might come slowly, it might not come at all. But nagging and looming won't make it come any faster — it will just slow things down.

### Brainstorming Tips

#### Brainstorming Tip #3: Draw

When you draw your ideas you remember them more easily, the pictures you draw will trigger more ideas. Start drawing — real rough. I guarantee you will find ideas popping into your head that simply weren't there a minute ago.

#### Brainstorm Tip #4: Toys

Another way to get your mind visually engaged in your problem is to bring some toys to the table. Pick some that have something to do with your problem, and some that have nothing to do with it!. **Toys don't just visually engage your creativity — they also engage it in a tactile way**. Even better, why not bring a big lump of clay, or Play-Doh, so you can make little sculptures of your ideas? It sounds silly, but creativity is silly.

#### Brainstorm Tip #5: Change Your Perspective

The whole point of the lenses in this book is that they get you **looking at your game from different perspectives**. But why stop there? Don't just brainstorm sitting in your chair — stand up on your chair — things look different up there! Go different places — immerse yourself in different things. Brainstorm on the bus, at the beach, at the mall, in a toy store, while standing on your head — **anything that sparks your imagination and makes you think of new things is worth doing**.

#### Brainstorm Tip #6: Immerse Yourself

You've stated your problem, now immerse yourself in it! Find people in your target audience — what are they buying? Why? What are they talking about? What is important to them? You need to know these people intimately. 

Have you settled on a technology already? Learn everything you can about it — cover your walls with its specs — find that secret thing it can do that no one has noticed yet. Are you locked into a theme or storyline? Find other adaptations of similar stories and read or watch them. Do you need to do something new with an old gameplay mechanic? Play as many games that use that mechanic as you can find — and some that don't!

#### Brainstorm Tip #7: Crack Jokes

When you are brainstorming, sometimes jokes are what get the job done. **Jokes loosen up our minds, and make us see things from a perspective that we missed before** — and new perspectives are how great ideas happen!.

Jokes can get you off track, especially in a group setting. It's fine to get off track sometimes, just make it your responsibility to get things back on track. A brainstorming commandment to live by: "He who derails, rerails."

#### Brainstorm Tip #8: Spare No Expense

From childhood, most of us are trained not waste resources. But **brainstorming is not the time to be frugal. Never let materials get in the way of your creativity**. You are going to be trying to find the million dollar ideas — you can't let a few pennies for paper or ink get in the way. 

When brainstorming i like to write only using one side of the paper. Partly because I can lay out all the sheets and consider all the ideas from a distance if I need to. And partly because it just feels right! And **when brainstorming, you need to do what feels right for you — every little thing you do that makes you a little more creatively comfortable increases the chances that the great idea will come**.

#### Brainstorm Tip #9: The Writing on the Wall

You might prefer writing on a whiteboard to writing on paper. If so, do it! Some people like to use index cards to write down their ideas. These can be tacked to a bulletin board and have the advantage of being easily repositioned.

I prefer giant Post-It sheets, or sheets of butcher paper with masking tape. This way, you can write lists on the wall, but easily reposition them when you run out of room. Even better, you can take them down, stack them, roll them up, store them and restart your brainstorming session as if it had never stopped.

#### Brainstorm Tip #10: The Space Remembers

This excellent phrase is from the book The Art of Innovation by Tom Kelley. Our memory for lists is bad, but **our memory for where things are positioned around us is very good**. By using a room you can more easily remember where they are. This is crucial, since you will be trying to find connections between dozens of different ideas.

It is quite remarkable. If you put a bunch of ideas up on the walls, and you go away for a few weeks, you will forget most of it. But walk back into that room where the ideas are posted, and it feels like you never left.

#### Brainstorm Tip #11: Write Everything

> The best way to have a good ideas is to have a lot of ideas. – Linus Pauling

You've got everything you think you might need to be creative. Now **don't wait for a brilliant idea — just start writing down everything you can think of that is remotely connected to your problem**. Write down every stupid idea that comes into your head, you have to get the stupid ones out of the way before the good ones start showing up. 

Sometimes a stupid idea becomes the inspiration for a genius idea, so write it all down. **Don't censor yourself. You have to give up your fear of being wrong and your fear of looking silly**. If you are brainstorming with other people, don't censor them — their stupid ideas are just as good as your stupid ideas!

#### Brainstorm Tip #12: Number Your Lists

Much of your brainstorming will consist of lists. When you make lists, number them! This does two things: First, it makes the lists easier to discuss, secondly, when a list of things is numbered, the numbers somehow give a certain dignity to the things in the list.

Numbered list seem more important, somehow? This dignity will make you more likely to take the ideas on the list seriously.

#### Brainstorm Tip #13: Mix and Match Categories

It's great when game ideas, Athena-like, spring forth from your head, fully formed. But it doesn't happen that way every time. A great technique for helping ideas come together is to brainstorm in categories. The elemental tetrad comes in handy here. For example, you might have decided you want to make a game for teenage girls. You might make separate lists, which you can start to mix and match. Something like 

**Technology Ideas**
1. Cell phone platform
2. Handheld game
3. PC
4. Integrated with instant messaging
5. Game console

**Mechanics Ideas**
1. Sims-like game
2. Interactive fiction game
3. The winner makes the most friends
4. Try to spread rumors about the other players
5. Try to help as many people as possible
6. Tetris-like game

**Story Ideas**
1. High school drama
2. College-themed
3. You play cupid
4. You're a TV star
5. Hospital theme
6. Music theme
a. You're a rock star
b. You're a dancer

**Aesthetic Ideas**
1. Cel shaded
2. Anime style
3. All characters are animals
4. R & B music defines the game
5. Edgy rock/punk music defines the feel

Once you have lists like these you are free to start mixing and matching ideas — maybe a cell-phone based Tetris-like game, which has a hospital theme, where all the characters are animals. By **having all these lists of partial ideas that can easily be mixed and matched, fully formed game ideas that you might never have thought of start springing up all over the place, each taking on a life of their own**. Don't be afraid to make up other categories.

#### Brainstorm Tip #14: Talk To Yourself

When brainstorming alone, some people find it really helpful — there is something about **saying things out loud that makes them more real than just thinking them in your head**. Find a place where you can freely talk to yourself without getting funny looks.

#### Brainstorm Tip #15: Find a Partner

When you brainstorm with other people, it is a very different experience than brainstorming alone. Finding the right brainstorming partner can get to great solutions many times faster than alone, as you bounce ideas back and forth and complete one another's sentences. Just having someone to talk out loud to, even if they say nothing, can sometimes move the process along faster. 

Do keep in mind that adding more and more people doesn't necessarily help, though. Usually, small groups of no more than four are best. Groups work best when brainstorming a narrow problem, not a broad, open-ended one. Also, certain people make bad brainstorming partners — these are usually people who try to poke holes in every idea, or people who have very narrow tastes. These people are best avoided, and you'll be more productive without them. Team brainstorming can have tremendous benefits and tremendous perils, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 23.

## Look At All These Ideas! Now What?

Our goal with this chapter was to "Think of an idea." After a little brainstorming, you probably have a hundred! And this is how it should be. A game designer must be able to come up with dozens of ideas on any topic. As you practice, you will be able to come up with more and better ideas in less time. But this is just the beginning of your design process. The next step is to narrow down this broad list of ideas, and start doing something useful with them.
