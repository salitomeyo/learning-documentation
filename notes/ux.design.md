This information was compiled while following the [UX Design College Class taught by a University UX instructor](https://www.udemy.com/course/userexperiencedesign/) udemy course and his page [UX Honey](http://uxhoney.com/)

## Why setting goals?

All the UX design decisions should be map to reason and logic, undestanding different goals are important aspects that regard to the reason why you are solving certain problem and how this solution intends to benefit the business

We have to track abd neasyre iver time if these solutions are gelping the business achieve this goals

## The kickoff meeting

Its a full meeting to talk about 

1. The business goals
2. The product goals 
3. The users and their goals 
4. The stakeholders
5. The risks and mitigations

It should involve everyone in the meeting before everyone starts doing work

### Business goals

#### WHY

You will want to know key performance indicators (KPI's) that inform business analytics. `Understand the business goals and how they map to milestones that your design will need to achieve`

#### Questions

* What ypu intend to achieve by building software?
* How is the business going to benefit from this software experience?
* What does suceess look like for the software business?

### Product goals

#### WHY

Understand what the business thinks are possible product goals, `what we need of the software to achieve business goals`. These goals can change, dependeing on the research and solution testing outcomes

#### Questions

* What does your product need to do to achieve business goals?
* If your product was a human what would it spend its time doing?

### User and their goals

#### WHY

User centered design (UCD). You can also use this meeting to prioritize users if the application has many personas. This will give you the focus and starting point

You will need to capture high level information and user profiles 

* Targeted markets 
* Target users
* Targeted users goals and problems
* Internal users are different than consumers

#### QUESTIONS

##### About the user

* User name and about them
* Their goals 
* Their pains or problems
* How do you get a hold of these people for research and testing

##### In general

* Who are the people that we are targeting to achieve the product goals?
* What do you know about them?
* What problems are most important for you to solve for them?
* What are these people's most important goals and whats motivating them?
* Are they close by? Where can i find them? Can anyone connect me to them? 

### Stakeholders

#### WHY

You'll have to design reviews to show results from research and solution experiments every 2 weeks. They can disrupt the design if they dont trust whats happening due to lack of involvement (stakeholder anxiety)

Is important to involve stakeholders from early on with "design sprints". The m ore you can involve them the less they will tell you how to design

#### QUESTIONS

Usually a PM will take care of this but if its up to ypu to handle it make sure to answer

* Who makes decision on product and business?
* Who has technical knowledge we can use as Subject matter expert (SME)?
* Who can help us find users? 
* What are their schedules and what time is good to have design reviews?


### Risks and mitigations

#### WHY

A risk is anything that can block, disrupt or fail a project or software. A risk can be turned into a question. You need to know what makes a project unsuccessful and prioritize activities that intend to mitigate the mos ASSUMED risks

#### QUESTIONS

* What are the things that can happen that will make this unsuccessful and not achieve our goals?
* Let's say we failed, what are the things you think caused us to fail?
* Whats the 1st thing we can do to start mitigation these unsuccessful events?
