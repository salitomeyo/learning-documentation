After you conducted all the interviews (at least 5 to 7 people) we organize our information using the following methods

## The Synthesis

Write down insights in sticky notes, all the insights about a interviewee will be represented in the same color sticky note, this will help us prepare our information for a systematic approach

> This can be done with real sticky notes and whiteboards, but if we find it difficult we can use applications that simulate this, one of the best free and colaborative one is [miro](https://miro.com/)

## The Cluster

Find patters and themes, patterns help us identify points of interest, priority, validations

> This can be done with the whole team, its important to do this step with more than one person, we need different perspectives

1. Create broad categories and reorganize the sticky notes according to the categories they fit in
2. Separate patterns within the broad categories, you can go as granular and specific as you choose

## The problem statement

It helps us articulate and understand the problem we are facing

We can use the following template to write our problem statement [[Problem Statement Template|assets/documents/the_problem_statement.pdf]]
