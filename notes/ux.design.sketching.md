Concepts and frameworks that will easily allow us to turn our ideas into visuals

## Value prop

Is a quick way to place our persona in the enviroment with their problem and proposed solution side by side. The proposed solution should be conceptual and doesn't include UI work-flows

We are focusing on quantity over quality, we want as many ideas as we can get even if they are not perfect

* Each person draws at least 5 concepts
* Each person gets 3 votes
* Each person gets a 3 minutes to explain their ideas
* Everyone votes, those ideas without votes get eliminated

We do this to eliminate ideas that wont help us, not to choose the one we want to expand on

We can use the following [[Value prop template|assets/documents/the_value_prop.pdf]]

## 4-UP

Is a quick way to sketch out 4 different tscreen designs or scenarios without getting into the "weeds" about the details of the solutions

You can expland on the details with the explanation if you dont have enough time to fit them in

* Each person draws one of the quadrants

We can use the following [[4-UP template|assets/documents/the_4_up.pdf]]

> Note: remember this sketches are not meant to be beautiful nor perfect, we are just trying to create quick visuals
