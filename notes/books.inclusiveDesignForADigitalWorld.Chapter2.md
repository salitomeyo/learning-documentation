# Accessibility, Content, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the Land of Accessible Rich Internet Applications

With great design we can remove the barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world

>Key concepts: web standards defined, importance of web content, html and seo, css, js and ARIA

## Governing on the web

We use the W5H to create an approach that asks the following questions

* Who can use this entrance/exit?
* What do you see when you look at this photo?
* When will people enter or exit?
* Why would people use the ramp or stairs?
* How does this apply to the digital world?

We need to take notice and realize that **what we think is accessible is often times not** and that depends on many factors including the design

The governing organizations create regulations that can help us understand what is really accessible

## W3C

### WCAG

W3C developed standards when it comes to making the web accessible, calling it the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**.

### Web content

Its important for any readership to have a proper layout, concise content, importance hierarchy, there are some key layout best practice that everyone must follow when developing a inclusive website

# Best practices

On first glance we must be able to clearly find titles, headings and links

We can break out the content of a page in:

* Headers
* Titles
* Paragraphs
* Images
* Forms
* Links

## Headers

Beforeusign a header we have to ask "what is most important?" and match it with a header that accomodates this level of importance

## Links

They should have enough contrast and clearly tell the user where they are being send
