* **Suppose you find a bug in production. How would you make sure that the same bug is not introduced again?**

The functionality with the bug uncaught will be added to the regression testing test cases this way we make sure its now covered as part of your regression testing. We will make sure that the same bug is not introduced again by having thoroughly testing as a form of regression.

And if you are already having some regression automation suite, then you will write a new automation script which validates that bug related functionality.

* **What do you do when a developer denies that what you find is a bug?**

Provide proper business documentation,the evidence to support your statement that existing functionality is not as requested.

Involve your product or business analyst to open discussion because they are the one who produces your requirements.

If developers are unable to replicate the bug then provide proper screenshots, give timestamp, to refer the developer to the application logs, provide whatever data you have used for replicating this issue.

* **What has been one of your greatest challenges while doing regression testing?**

One common challenge with every project faces is just data issue. After repeatedly testing your application either the data runs out or the data becomes corrupted which can produce errors that are not actually there

Improper selection of test cases that can lead to major bugs to be pass onto production

Time because regression without proper automation can be a rather slow process but sometimes time given is not enough, or there are too many bugs that need to be retested 

* **Key challenges that are faced while performing software testing.**

Data issues
Environment availability
Choosing the right set of tools

* **What are drawbacks of Agile methodology that you faced?**

Sprints are usually very deadline constraint. So you will be forced to complete testing in that specific duration. And that is really a kind of drawback because you will not have much exposure to think and test it in from different aspects because of the deadline constraints. 

Documentation is not priority as requirements come in fly.

Changes in requirements which makes automatizations and test cases are hard to mantain.

* **What is your approach when you have a high priority release to be deliverd in a really short time window?**

First run all the automation suites, this will cover a big part of the application and save us time

Do manual testing only on high priority business test cases and in the new fuctionalities 

If there is enough time do exploratory testing

* **What is a test plan?**

Test plan is one document that will contain the scope of your testing, approach, resources and outline of the testing project as well as the activities for tracking the progress of the project and what

* **What will be your reaction if a project what you are working got sudden change in its deadline to deliver?**

Be open with your thoughts on wether the QA team will be able to deliver the sign off on time covering all the test cases or if you can see any risk

If the release is a must discuss opportunities to increase QA resources or deliver the product partially

* **What is the difference between smoke test and sanity test?**

Sanity testing is a kind of software testing performed after receiving a software build, with minor changes in code or functionality to ascertain that bugs have been fixed and no further bug was introduced due to changes 

Smoke testing is a special type of testing performed on a software build to check critical functionalities of the program

* **Differentiate Ad-Hoc testing and exploratory testing?**

Adhoc testing includes learning the application first and first and then proceed to testing

Exploratory testing includes learning while testing the application
