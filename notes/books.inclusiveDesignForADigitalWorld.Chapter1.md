# Designing with accesibility in mind 

People with visual, auditory, motor, speech, and
cognitive disabilities rely on various assistive technologies and alternate
methods of interaction to use digital documents and web and mobile apps

* **Visual disabilities**: screen readers, braille
displays, zoom functions, or high contrast colors. 
* **Auditory disabilities**: captions or transcripts for video content. 
* **Motor disabilities**:  speech-to-text software or keyboard-only interactions.
* **Speech disabilities**: nonvocal means of interaction.
* **Cognitive disabilities**: thoughtful and
organized layouts with clear direction.

Without this assistive technologies almost 90% of the web is innacesible for impared individuals 

## What is accessibility

Easily used or accessed by people with disabilities; adapted for
use by people with disabilities

Accessibility not only refers to compliance but to usability

## Accessibility Areas

Accessibility focuses in 4 main areas 

* **Visual**: Blindness, low vision, color blindness
* **Hearing**: Deaf and hard of hearing
* **Motor**: Inability to use a mouse, slow response time,
limited motor control
* **Cognitive**: Learning disabilities, distractability, inability
to focus on large amounts of information

## Medical vs Social Model of Disability

Under the medical model the impairments or differences should
be “fixed” or changed by medical and other treatments. This view of the disabilities didnt align with the real experiences of disabled people, because of this they created their own model.

The **Social Model of Disability states that Disability is caused by the way society is organized**,
rather than by a person’s impairment or difference. It focuses in what the person needs

## User Centered Design (UCD) vs Design thinking

**UCD** is an iterative process which follows 5 big steps

* Research
* Concept
* Design
* Develop
* Test

**Design thinking** is an iterative process in which we seek to understand
the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems in an attempt to
identify alternative strategies and solutions.

Its one of the more popular methodologies people use, its not only a way of thinkin but also a collection of hands-on methods, it consists of 5 steps

* Empathize
* Define
* Ideate
* Prototype
* Test

This provides a solution-based approach to solving problems

### Empathy map

It consists of 4 cuadrants surrounding the user

* SAYS
* THINKS
* DOES
* FEELS

To better understand the empathy map we have to answer 
the following questions

* Empathize—Learn about your audience: Who is my
user? What matters to my audience?
* Define—Create a point of view: What are their needs?
* Brainstorm—Come up with creative solutions: Wild
ideas encouraged!
* Build a representation: How can I show my idea?
Prototype is a rough draft!
* Share and ask for feedback: What worked? What
didn’t?

### Red–Green Color Blindness
The most common types of hereditary color blindness are due to the loss
or limited function of red cone (known as protan) or green cone (deutran)
photopigments.

* **Protanomaly**: X-linked disorder, the red
cone photopigment is abnormal. Red, orange, and
yellow appear greener and colors are not as bright.
Is mild. Estimated to affect 1% of males.
* **Protanopia**: X-linked disorder, there are no
working red cone cells. Red appears as black. Certain
shades of orange, yellow, and green all appear as
yellow. Estimated to affect 1 percent of males.
* **Deuteranomaly**: X-linked disorder, the
green cone photopigment is abnormal. Yellow and
green appear redder, and it is difficult to tell violet from
blue. Is mild. Most common form
of color blindness affecting
5% of males.
* **Deuteranopia**: X-linked disorder, there are
no working green cone cells. They tend to see reds as
brownish-yellow and greens as beige. Affects about 1% of males.

### Blue–Yellow Color Blindness
Blue–yellow color blindness is rarer than red–green color blindness. Bluecone (tritan) photopigments are either missing or have limited function.

* **Tritanomaly**: People with tritanomaly have functionally
limited blue cone cells. Blue appears greener, and
it can be difficult to tell yellow and red from pink. Extremely rare autosomal
dominant disorder.
* **Tritanopia**: People with tritanopia, also known as
blue–yellow color blindness, lack blue cone cells. Blue
appears green and yellow appears violet or light grey.
Extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder.

### Complete Color Blindness
People with complete color blindness (monochromacy) don’t experience color at all, and the clearness of their vision (visual acuity) may also be
affected. There are two types of monochromacy:

* **Cone monochromacy**: This rare form of color blindness results from a failure of two of the three cone cell photopigments to work. There is

    * Red cone monochromacy
    * Green cone monochromacy
    * Blue cone monochromacy. 

People with cone
monochromacy have trouble distinguishing colors
because the brain needs to compare the signals from
different types of cones in order to see color. When
only one type of cone works, this comparison isn’t
possible. People with blue cone monochromacy may 
also have reduced visual acuity, nearsightedness, and
uncontrollable eye movements, a condition known
as nystagmus. Cone monochromacy is an autosomal
recessive disorder.

* **Rod monochromacy or achromatopsia**: This type of
monochromacy is rare and is the most severe form
of color blindness. It is present at birth. None of the
cone cells have functional photopigments. Lacking
all cone vision, people with rod monochromacy see
the world in black, white, and gray. And since rods
respond to dim light, people with rod monochromacy
tend to be photophobic (very uncomfortable in bright
environments). They also experience nystagmus. Rod
monochromacy is an autosomal recessive disorder.
