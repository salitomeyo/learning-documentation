After we have done our whole design research, system and prototyping its time to show the results. How can we show the results in a way we can easily involve everyone and make them want to follow it?

## The wow

Its important to show the initial stage and the final products, make the slideshow interactive, add videos, anything that can show how the application will work in the real world, wow the viewer
