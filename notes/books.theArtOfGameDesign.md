## What is Game Design?

Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be. To decide what a game is, you must make hundreds, usually thousands of decisions. To be a game designer there is no need to be a programmer but you should know everything the programmers are capable of

The game designer is not the only one allowed to make decisions about a game, anyone who makes decisions about how the game should be is a game designer.

> The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. — Marcel Proust

Good game design happens when you view your game from as many perspectives as possible. I refer to these perspectives as lenses, because each one is a way of viewing your design. The lenses are small sets of questions you should ask yourself about your design. They are not blueprints or recipes, but tools for examining
your design. 

Not only will this book draw design inspiration from everywhere, it will persuade you to do the same. Everything you know and everything you have experienced is fair game at the game design table.

There’s an saying among game designers: 

> Your first ten games will suck — so get them out of the way fast.

Its important to note that this book will not go into specifics, it will give you a map, an outline you can follow to develop games but not specifically videogames nor any type or genre, and it wont give you all the answers either it is design in a way that will strive curiosity, if you need a book that will dive into the specifics then do not read it
