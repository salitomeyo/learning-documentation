## Len #1 - Lens of Essential Experience 

It is true that many designers do not use the Lens of Essential Experience. They just kind of follow their gut instinct, and stumble across game structures that happen to enable experiences that people enjoy. The danger with this approach is that it relies on luck to a large extent. 

To be able to separate the experience from the game is very useful: If you have a **clear picture in your mind of the experiences your players are having, and what parts of your game enable that experience**, you will have a much clearer picture of how to make your game better, because you will know which elements of the game you can safely change, and which ones you cannot. 

**`The ultimate goal of the game designer is to deliver an experience. When you have a clear picture of your ideal experience, and its essential elements, your design has something to aspire to.`** Without that goal you are just wandering in the dark.

## Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise

Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to **remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises.** Ask yourself these questions:

* What will surprise players when they play my game?
* Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment, it's at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. Brain scans revealed that even during
unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.

## Lens #3: The Lens of Fun

Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game's fun, ask yourself these questions:

* What parts of my game are fun? Why?
* What parts need to be more fun?

---

## Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity

Think about the player's true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those
goals. Ask yourself these questions:

* What questions does my game put into the player's mind?
* What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
* What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

---

## Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value

To use this lens, think about your players' feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is valuable to the players in my game?
* How can I make it more valuable to them?
* What is the relationship between value in the game and the player's motivations?

Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.

---

## Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving

To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to succeed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these
questions:

* What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
* Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
* How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?

---

## Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad

To use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole. Ask yourself these questions:

* Is my game design using elements of all four types?
* Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
* Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?

---

## Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design

To use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four elements and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is acceptable to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically. Ask yourself these questions:

* What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
* What elements of the game detract from the experience?
* How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

---

## Lens #9: The Lens of Unification

To use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is my theme?
* Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

The Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can
more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.

---

## Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance

To use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
* If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
* I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?

---

## Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration

> When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru. – Ram Dass

To you use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games like it. Instead, look everywhere else.

Ask yourself these questions:

* What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?
* In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?

---

## Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement

To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem. Ask yourself these questions:

* What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
* Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
* Is a game really the best solution? Why?
* How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

---

## Lens #13 - The Lens of the Eight Filters

To use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must satisfy. **You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all eight filters without requiring a change**. Ask yourself the eight key questions:

* Does this game feel right?
* Will the intended audience like this game enough?
* Is this a well-designed game?
* Is this game novel enough?
* Will this game sell?
* Is it technically possible to build this game?
* Does this game meet our social and community goals?
* Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?

In some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educational game will also have to answer questions like "Does this game teach what it is supposed to?" If your design requires more filters, don't neglect them.

---

## Lens # 14: The Lens of Risk Mitigation

To use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the things that could go horribly wrong with your game. Ask yourself these questions:

* What could keep this game from being great?
* How can we stop that from happening?

---

## Lens # 15: The Lens of the Toy

To use this lens,<**stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with**. Ask yourself these questions:

* If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?
* When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, evenbefore they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?

There are two ways to use the Lens of the Toy. One way is on an existing game, to figure out how to make it more approachable, and more fun to manipulate. But the second way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have any idea what games will be played with them.
