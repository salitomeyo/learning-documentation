There are lots of modifiers we can apply to our objects, they are divided in 4 categories

## Modify
## Generate

The help us generate other objects usually using out original object as a template

* **Mirror**: Allows us to mirror our object using the axis positioning and a pivot point
* **Multiresolution**: Allows us to subdivide our shape in order to create smaller polygons, this helps us achieve smoother results 
* **Bevel**: Allows us to create bevels in every edge of our object
* **Array**: It create a list of duplicates of the object all equidistant between one another in x, y, z (the starting position of each element is the final position of the previous element) by the separation amounts set, and we can also create the same effect but in the rotation (For this you have to activate the object offset, select and empty object or any other you want to apply the rotation to, every step of the array will be affected by this rotation amount, the starting position of each element is the final position of the previous element)
