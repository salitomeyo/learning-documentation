# Compliance and Accessibility

Compliance is not the same as accessible, one way to ensure accessibility is following the WCAG guidelines which focus on 4 main success areas

* Perceivable
* Operable
* Understandable
* Robust 

Also known as POUR

## A step in the right direction

In the past 15 yearns international goverments have developed legislations to ensure equal rights for people with disabilities, this legislations include equivalent access to electronic and information technology

Is a good practice to keep in mind the different regulations regarding this topic for the country or countries you are aiming your product to

As well as the international standards

* Web content accessibility guidelines 2.0
* WAI policy page
* ETSI technical Report TR 102 612
* WCAG 2.1 highlights
* POUR
* ADA's impact on web

[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) offers a great breakdown of the WCAG 

## POUR

### Percivable: Providing text alternatives

One of the simplest ways to make a page more accessible is provinding alt-text to the images, this way any person with some sort of visual disability will be able to understand the purpose of an image even if they can see it, another great example is offering close caption on videos, this makes the content not only accessible for user with visual disabilities but it also helps improve the experience of non native speakers

#### Captions 
But is every caption good enough? accessibility advocates have gotten to a consensus "auto captions are not accessible" because they are really prone to errors, search engines dont even take it into account because is not realiable

This are some of the benefits that caption can bring your content

* Accessible: 20% of Americans over age 12 experience significant enough hearing loss that it interferes with daily communication. Not captioning means that your videos are not accessible to 1/5 of your potential audience (in America, at least).
* Searchable: Also, Google and other search engines can’t watch a video. Not captioning means that your videos can only be found based on their titles. What about all the incredible keywords and search terms you have in your video? Google has no idea about those.
* Engaging: At its core, captioning helps people understand more. If English is not your viewer’s first language, they’re more likely to follow if there are captions. Regardless, captions help all users engage more, which keeps them watching your video longer—which search engines reward in rankings

**Something is better than nothing** Creating captions for content from scratch takes time and effort, so the best strategy maybe to use the automatically generated caption than to put no captions at all, under good conditions youtube automatic captions accurracy can be as high as 80%, and then edit the captions which can improve accuracy a lot

**WCAG Success Criteria for captions** 
Specific Benefits of Success Criterion 1.2.2
* People who are deaf or have a hearing loss can access the auditory information in the synchronized media content through captions.

Always take into account that Captioning is something many people cannot live without and provides them an opportunity to view, learn, and be entertained on things that they could not engage with otherwise. Provided the option of captions makes your products more accessible overal
