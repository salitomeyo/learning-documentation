## Values

**Is how light or dark an area is, values dont need hues** (colors) they could vary massively without integrating any color

Hues can vary without changing the meaning of a painting, you could paint a blue face without losing realism as long as the values (lights and darks) dont change

**Every hue can be combined with black and white values to create a tone** (which is the scale from white to black of said hue, like the color in a brightness scale)

The colors formed when adding white are called tint and when adding black are called shades

Try to order different colored columns with different hues into their value order

## Brightness

**Colors can have the same amount of black and white added to the original hue but appear in different levels of brightness for us**, so brightness is more perceptual 

Our eyes are more accostumed to perceive the further ends of the spectrum (hard contrasts) which means colors that appear to have medium levels of brightness are colors we want to avoid

## Brightness Examples

Making a range of the same hue with **different values can create a scale that is nice for the colors closer to the middle but is not as nice for the colors on the edges** (the lightess and darkess colors dont look natural, the lightess is too bright and the darkess is too dark)

We can adjust the Hues choosen varing them in accordance with the value range

* **High Value Colors**: Mix in a bit of a bright hue (like yellow, cyan or magenta)
* **Low Value Colors**: Mix in a bit of a less bright hue (like red, blue or of green) to low value colors 

This makes the colors less bright, nicer and more comfortable to perceive

## Color Matching

You very **rarely just have white light on a composition**, which means colors are probably influencing each other and bouncing around

When creating a composition you can a bit of your primary color to every other color you choose to give a more consistent look

A better yet approach is to **add a bit of color according to the perceived depth of the elements**, you can add background elements a bit more blueish/purpleish tones and for elements that should be closer to us like buttons and titles you could mix more orangy/red tones

## Color Saturation

Is **how pure the wavelenght is, less color saturation makes the colors more muddy** (how pure or gray a color is), colors with less saturation are harder to recognise 

Using less satured colors on our compositions can ease the strain on the eye so its recommended to always have some desaturated colors on our designs

Find a design and try to desaturate the most of the colors (without necesarily going for completely gray hues)

## Contrast

We **dont create contrast only with black and white, we can also contrast colors** like yellow and blue

**There is also saturation contrasts** a bright yellow background with bright blue letters it is quite hard to perceive but if you lower the saturation of the yellow it can be quite nice and more visually interesting, colors dont try overpowering each others but on the opposite 

**Contrasting colors are complete opposites on the color wheel** but not all color wheels that you will find on the internet are correct so the best way to tell **2 colors are contrasting colors is to supperpone them, they should make perfect gray**

A correct representation of a color wheel should have cyan, magenta and yellow equidistant and blue, green, and red equidistant making the direct opposites yellow and blue, cyan and red, green and magenta
