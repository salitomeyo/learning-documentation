** *How to feat different elements on a page? what is the most visually pleasing way to arrange something on a canvas?* **

The best way to learn composition is trying it out, this page will contain small explanations followed by and exercise to get some hands on experience, `composition is about being able to train your eyes and master your intution`

1. **Create a composition** where you frame a square, how many different compositions can you come up with?

## Expression

Compositions convey feelings is important to be able to express something even with the simplest elements

2. **Create compositions** for different emotion words, try to convey that emotion just with squares

## Balance

Unbalanced things feel unnatural, think of a tree with all the branches in one side, **creating balance doesnt mean making things conservatory nor symmetrical** althought it could, a tree can have a big branch on one side and multiple small branches on the other side and be balanced. 

We can also use colors and darkness to create balance, something big with a dull color may create enough balance with a smaller object with a brighter or darker color

1. **Create compositions** using shapes and darkness that feels balanced (without being symmetrical)

## Contrast

There needs to be balance but to much balance might seem dull and boring, if you make a tree with exactly seven branches on each side on the exact same position with the exact same form it will feel unrealistic and boring. We need a reasonable amount of balance, and **a reasonable amount of contrast, some element of caos, this keeps the composition interesting and stimulates the brain**. 

Shape, color and texture can be used to create contrast, but limit the attributes that you can change or the amount of element you can use, a lot of contrast can make things chaotic, or make it seem like the objects belong in completely different worlds

1. **Create compositions** with some level of contrast, invent rules to keep a sense of conformity and avoid going too complex

## Forms

**Shapes carry meaning, the way the shapes are presented also carries meaning**, the nature of the trace, the patterns, colors and textures can help convey a feeling. A rounded triangle seems friendlier than a sharp triangle, flowing wavy patterns seem more nature related than straight patterns 

Try to express feelings with your compositions, separate patterns, textures, forms and shapes and try to figure out their innate meaning

1. **Create compositions** using the compositions you have already done but play with shape, texture, patterns and lines

## Hierarchy

**Informs the user of the importance of each part, and the order in which the composition is meant to be consumed**, you can also use hierarchy to make things more important

New designers usually use text size and potentially moving things up, but there is many others we can use, we can use different colors, avoid having more than five things with the same importance because it may cause indecision in the user, **we want to help the user navigate intuitively** throught the parts we consider important

Train your intuition to make hierarchies, look at newspapers, pictures, art, and try to figure out what is the most important part and why it looks important

1. **Create compositions** using shape and color that have a clear hierarchy, keep increasing the number of elements in the compositions and see if you can still differentiate the most important thing

## Relations

**How we make different elements seem like they belong together?** we can use patterns, closeness, similar features like size or color, they could have lines connecting them or be overlapping the same shape, or contained within another shape

1. **Create compositions** with hierarchy but combine some elements in relations 

## Alignment

Once the composition start being more complex they will start to feel chaotic so we create rules to create a sense of comformity and limit our creative chaos

**Following an alignment with clear rules can make the composition less chaotic even if it contains the same amount of elements**, imagine we have a composition make it follow a grid, we can make a rule that only one of the elements can be misaligned, or maybe we can make all the elements align to the middle, or have the exact same spacing in between one another

1. **Recreate your last compositions** but be more aware of the alignment, make the alignment a concientious decision

## Sequence and Pace

Imagine your composition as a song, the placement of the elements gives our composition the pace and sequence, we can skip some beats, elongate them, replace them for different sounds (colors), put them off beat (off grid), in order to make our song more insteresting

But rather than pace from left to right think of creating pace from top to bottom (we do this in order to accommodate to mobile devices)

1. **Create compositions** where vertically spaced horizontal lines are your pace, draw different background boxes that align to these lines to create a sequence, finally add other elements using everything we have learned
