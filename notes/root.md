This Dendron Vault contains notes from different Topics i have been learning recently. In order to keep track of everything and be ablo to come back to remember somethings.

**Disclaimer:** This is not meant to be a tutorial, the notes taken in this space are just things i found interesting while watching some courses on different topics, do not take this as word value

If this is in any way helpful to you i encourage you to check the udemy courses i have been doing, they will be linked in every topic.
