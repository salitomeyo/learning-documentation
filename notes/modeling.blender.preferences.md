* **F4**: It opens the file context submenu, in which we can view and change our preferences

## Keymap

It allows us to see all our key-binding preferences

* **Tab for pie Menu**: It lets us use tab to change between layout and modeling edit modes, and use tab while dragging the mouse to open the whole edit modes submenu
* **Spacebar actions**: we can set the more common use for us, in this case is better to let play if you work on animation or tools if you work on sculping, can be switched back anytime inside this menu
* **Activate gizmo event**: When we click an objets it displays a 3D axis that lets us move the object, we can choose wether we prefer to activate this gizmo functionality only by clicking or by dragging, it recommended to let the drag because the press can make it difficult to select other objects
* **Extra shading Pie menu items**: Activates more rendering options in the Z submenu, but its usually not necessary because the only other render commonly used can be activated using Shift+Z
* **Key-binding**: Scrolling down on the keymap window we can access and change any keybinding, and restore key bindings changes previously done, we can search the key binding we are trying to change either by name or the key binding itself but this can be kind of hard

## Interface 

We can use it to translate the interface and change the scale

* **Resolution Scale**: Its set to 1 by default but can be change to bigger or smaller numbers and will affect the buttons and font size
* **Translation**: We can use it to translate our blender to a different language, by default its in english
    * **Affect**: We can choose what we want to translate in case we aim to change a particular thing instead of the whole blender interface, Tooltips only affects that, New data will affect new creations like added primitives will be by dafault named in spanish or te chosen language, but interface will change the language in everything
* **Pie Menus**: Will allow us to change the animation, response time and overall size of the submenus

## Themes

Will let us change the color of every interaction an tool

* **3D Viewport**: Will not only allow us to change the color of every interaction seen inside the 3D viewport mode but also change the size of vertex, faces and outlines when selected

## Shortcuts

We can use the shortcuts presented before which are general shortcuts created on the original blender configuration or we can create our own custom shortcuts

* **Right-click**: On any tool to easily asign a shortcut or to add it to favourites

## Add-ons

Are plugins you can add to blender to increase its functionality, to access them you just have to enter the preferences menu and select the add-ons section

### Mesh: LoopTools

It help us shape our faces into diferent shapes, its really useful to create circles inside other shapes

We an access it using diferent commands but its important to keep in mind that you have to have a face selected before using it

* **N**: And select the edit dragable
* **Right-click**: And selecting the loopTools option in the submenu
