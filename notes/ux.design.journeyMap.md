## Customer journey map

Its a framework that helps us understand the current or future journey that our customer goes through

### Current journey

We use it to model the current problem scenario

We use it in the beginning if we have a domain expert, or towards the end of our research, once we know enough about the user and their problem

### Future journey

We use it to model the future solution scenario

We use it after research, to model concepts or validated solutions
