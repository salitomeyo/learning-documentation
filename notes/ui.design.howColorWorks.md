## Additive and subtractive

Primary colors have different behaviours according to the medium

* **Primary colors for light are called Additive** primary colors and are **Red, Blue and Green**, that why we use RGB when encoding colors onto code, they are called additive because they start from black and every addition brings the result closer to white
* **Primary colors in mediums like paint are called Subtractive** primary colors and have been teached culturaly as blue, red and yellow (but the actual substractive primary colors are **cyan, magenta, and yellow**), they are called substractive because they start from wait and every addition of brings the result closer to black

> Note: This colors are now being used because they can create the larger set of color with simple combinations that doesnt necesarily mean you can create every single color using only this

## Waves

**Light is a wave, what we perceive as different colors are simply different lenghts of waves**

This waves are not all perceivable by the human eye, waves with shorter lenght than violet are called ultraviolet and waves with longer lenght than red are called infrared

Is common for this waves to travel together but we only perceive the ones we can see

**When we see a color we are actually seeing a range of different wavelenghts**

A pure white light is actually all the different wavelenghts combined

Many objects like cristals and prisms can change the nature of waves and change the perceived colors

## Trichromatic Process

So how do things get their colors? Imagine an object under the sunlight (or any kind of white light), **the object is receiving every wave lenght but there are only some it can absorb, the wave lenghts an object can't absorb are reflected back and are the colors we perceive** objects to be

For example a leaf absorbs wavelenghts for purple, blue, orange, and red but it reflects the wave lenght for green and yellow

Those absortions and reflections are not perfect, which means most objects reflect a little bit of every wave lenght but is not perceivable under a white light, if we change the lighting the colors reflected will change the perceivable result

### Cones

**We have 3 different kinds of cones to identify colors, this are commonly called the blue, green and red receptors**, although this names are not accurrate

**We also have an intensity receptor that allows us to differentiate light and dark**

All this cones perform calculations, this calculations can return wrong results if any of the cones have problems leading to color blindness

## Chromaticity

Back in 1920s and 1930s there where a series of experiments changing the intensity of 3 **red, green and blue lights to identify the perceivable colors, the results where plotted on a 3D chart**

This 3D chart is quite irregular but looked at a certain angle it is possible to flatten it into a 2D view

This 2D representation of the perceivable color is not only also irregular but its impossible to generate using only 3 colored lights, so most softwares started using a section of the 2D representation but not all softwares use the same section which means you can find color variants to the same color if you use different softwares

Some of the different versions of this section are

* ProPhoto RGB
* Adove RGB 1998
* Colormatch RGB
* SWOP CMYK
* RGB
* sRGB
* D65 white point

To avoid this confussion all websites started using the same sample section **sRGB** or **Standard RGB** it uses 3 coordinates for **Red, Green and Blue axis from 0 to 255, each increment in this coordinates does not uniformly increase the intensity of light but rather ajust the light based on human perception**
