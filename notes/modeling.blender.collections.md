They are subenvironments in blender that allows us to group and control several primitives and objects in order to easier control blender archives with lots of components

## Different Collections

* **M**: When we click m while selecting an object we can create a new collection or add the objects to different collections
* **Numpad numbers**: Each collection can turn visible or invisible using the numpad numbers, they correspond to the order the collection were made in
* **Shift + Numpad numbers**: Turn visible or invisible various collections
* **Shift + M**: Move object to different collections but keeping the objects linked between collections which means all transformations applied to the elements in one collection will affect the same element in other collections
