Research conducted by psychologists Stephen E. Palmer and Karen Schloss and published on 2010 posits that `a person's preference for color can be determined by averaging how much that person likes all the things associated with that color`

And if you look at all the things associated with blue they are mostly positive, the ocean or any body of water, the sky, or more mundane things like jeans. But this associations differ from other colors cause they are universal, there are no cultural differences in perciving a sunny day or clear water, which makes **blue one of the most (if not the most) popular color world wide**

On the other hand colors like dark yellow are always the most disliked colors, they have a lot of negative associations, biological waste and other gross things

But we have to also take into account the individual variations, even tought mayority of people prefer blue there is also larges chunks of the population that prefer green and red

Color preferences is the summary of all the things we have experienced in our lifetime which means is not hardwired and it can change over time
