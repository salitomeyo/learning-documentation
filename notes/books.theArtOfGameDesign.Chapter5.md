> To write a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. – Herman Melville

## Mere Games

Great themes and deep meanings are often associated with literature or with great works of art. Is it pretentious for a "mere game" to aspire to the same levels of greatness? **We must confront the painful truth that many people view games, as meaningless diversions**. 

People who hold this view, I can admit some game that is very important to them. When I point out the hypocrisy of games as meaningless, but a game as meaningful, they explain, "Well, it really wasn't the game I cared about it was the experience that went with the game".

But as we've discussed, experiences aren't just associated with games at random, they are what emerge when players interact with a game. **The parts of the experience that are important to people all are determined by the design of the game**. Some people make the argument that games, especially videogames, cannot be deep and meaningful because they are simply too primitive in nature. As technology increases, this argument will fade away.

As technology advances, more and more aspects of human life and expression will be integrated into games. There is nothing that cannot be part of a game. But you cannot put a game into these other types of media, because they are subsets of games. **At their technological limit, games will subsume all other media**.

> The problem is games have only recently emerged as a serious medium of expression. It will take time for the world to grow used to this idea. But we can create games with powerful themes right now. 

But why? Out of a selfish need for artistic expression? No, because we are designers. It is possible to create games that do not have themes or that have very weak themes. However, **if our games have unifying, resonant themes, the experiences we create will be much, much stronger**.

### Unifying Themes

**The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another, since they will all be working toward a common goal**. Sometimes it is best to let a theme emerge as you are creating the game. The sooner you have settled on a theme, the easier things will be, you will have an easy **method of deciding if something belongs: If it reinforces the theme, it stays, but if it doesn't, it goes**.

There are two simple steps to using a theme to strengthen the power of your game's experience.

* Step 1: Figure out what your theme is.
* Step 2: Use every means possible to reinforce that theme.

What is a theme? **The theme is what your game is about. The idea that ties your entire game together and all the elements must support**. If you don't know the theme of your game it will probably be less engaging.

Most game themes are experience-based. Find a theme and then, look for opportunities to reinforce your theme in clever and unexpected ways, for example a children book about elephants step one completed the theme are elephants, step two reinforce the theme, the book could have pictures and text about them, but the book itself could be shaped as an elephant. 

We were tasked to recreate the Pirates of the Caribbean disney ride in a VR game. You can see that even with something as narrow as "pirates", we still didn't really have a theme, because there are many possible experiences around the idea of pirates that we could create. 

After much research, interviews and rides it clicked: The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is not about pirates, it is about being a pirate! The whole goal of the ride is to fulfill the fantasy of what it is like to throw aside the rules of society and just start being a pirate! and what better way
to create this feeling of being a pirate than through an immersive, interactive experience? We now had our experience-based theme: The fantasy of being a pirate.

For step two use every means possible to reinforce that theme. Some examples include:

* **Cave shape**: We created a new, four-screen Cave shape.
* **Motion Platform**: Feeling of a rocking, swaying boat. We custom built a platform using pneumatics.
* **Interface**: The ship is steered with a ship's wheel, and we had real metal cannons that players would use to aim and fire.
* **Visuals**: "hyper-real" look. We used high-end
graphics hardware and rich textures and models.
* **Music**: Use the music from the ride.
* **Audio**: Our sound designers created a custom ten-speaker sound system that could play sounds from all directions, making you feel like you were out at sea.
* **A Feeling of Freedom**: Piracy is all about freedom. Our gameplay mechanics were designed to let players sail wherever they chose, but at the same time ensure the players have an exciting time. Details of how this was accomplished will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16.
* **Dead Men Tell No Tales**: In the fantasy, you don't die, or if you do, it is in an incredibly dramatic way, and you do not return. We were trying very hard to maintain a dramatic interest curve (explained in Chapter 14). If the players could suddenly die in the middle of the game, it would spoil that. Our solution make players invulnerable throughout the majority of the game, but if they took too many hits their ship would sink dramatically at the end of the final battle. This broke with videogame tradition. But
> theme is more important than tradition.
* **Treasure**: We came up with a special technique that made flat, handpainted treasures seem to be solid, dimensional objects that sat prominently on the ship's deck.
* **Lighting**: We needed to light the room the players stood in. How could we theme that? We used special filters on the light that made it look like it was light reflected off of water.
* **A Place for my Stuff**: People who step up to the controls need a place to put their bags, purses, etc. We created bags out of fishing nets that really look like they belong on a boat.
* **Air Conditioning**: The vents were placed at the front of the ship, blowing back, so players feel a breeze as they sail their ship.
* **The Eyes of Bluebeard**: We never figured out how to theme was the 3D glasses. We gave up, and let that detail go unthemed. To our surprise, the cast member who was about to lead us on board proclaimed "Before ye board, ye must wear the Eyes of Bluebeard". The ride attendants succeeded where we had failed. It was a simple and effective way to theme a detail that escaped us, and a powerful illustration that when you have a strong unifying theme, it makes it easier for everyone on the team to make useful contributions.

This is not a complete list. Everything we did and every decision we made was focused on whether it would reinforce the theme and deliver the essential experience we wanted to get across. You might argue that without a big budget, you can't afford
to do fancy theming. But **many theming details are really quite inexpensive. They can be a line of text, or a color choice, or a sound effect**. And theming is fun — once you get in the habit of trying to make as many things as possible fit your theme, it's hard to stop. But why would you stop? And this gives us Lens #9.

### Resonance

A unifying theme is good — it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some themes are better than others. **The best themes are ones that resonate with players — themes that touch players deeply**.

The "fantasy of being a pirate" theme is powerful because it is a fantasy that everyone has had at one time or another. It resonates with our desire to be free.

When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have something deep and powerful that has a true ability to **move people and to give them an experience that is both transcendent and transforming**. Earlier we discussed that some themes are experience-based, **when this experience is one that resonates with the fantasies and desires of your players, it will be an experience that quickly becomes important to them**.

But there is another kind of theme just as resonant this is the **truth-based theme**. Consider the movie Titanic, you might say that the theme was the Titanic itself and its tragic accident. But the main theme is not experience-based. Instead, **it is a simple statement**, which I would phrase as something like *"Love is more important than life, and stronger than death"*. This is a powerful statement. **But it is a statement that many of us believe deeply in our heart of hearts**

## Lens #9: The Lens of Unification

To use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is my theme?
* Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

The Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can
more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.

It is certainly not a scientific truth, but for many, it is a deeply held, though rarely expressed, personal truth.

Many did not believe this movie could possibly be successful: audiences would know the ending. But where better to tell a story that fits this powerful theme than in a place where we know almost everyone is going to die? we must feel like it is all real, like we are right there, like we are dying ourselves.

**Truth-based themes can sometimes be hard to spot. Part of the power of these deep truths is that they are hidden**. Often, a designer might not even consciously know they have chosen a particular theme or be able to express it verbally.

**Explore your feelings about these things to the point that you can express your theme concretely.** It will make it much easier for you to decide what should and shouldn't go into your game, and make it easier for you to explain the rationale of these decisions to others on your team.

Another example of a truth-based theme is the Hercules story. When a story stays alive, told and retold, for thousands of years like Hercules has, it is a pretty good clue that there is a truth-based theme hiding inside it. 

Interestingly, there was not one canonical telling, even in ancient times. Sometimes Hercules had ten labors, sometimes twelve, and sometimes twenty. But in every story, Hercules is a man so virtuous that he defeats death. And this is a truth so deep that it is at the heart of many religions: If you are virtuous enough, you can defeat death. 

## Toontown online project

Another Disney story: when we started work on the Toontown Online project (Disney's first massively
multiplayer game), we were again unsure of our theme. The reason it was so ill-defined was that everyone seemed to already have a sense of what it was. We started making lists of things we thought Toontown should be about. Three big ones stood out:

1. Having fun with your friends
2. Escaping from reality
3. Simplicity and transcendence

The first one lent itself really well to online networked play, and we liked that. The second one made a lot of sense — cartoons are a good form of escapism. The third one (which we'll be exploring in more detail in Chapter 17) is basically the
idea that things are simpler in Toontown than they are in the real world, but you are also more powerful in Toontown than you are in the real world.

All of this helped clarify what we wanted to see in the game, but none of it really established a clear theme. These felt more like sub-themes. These three things together strongly characterize something: play. Play is about having fun with your friends and escaping from reality, and a play world is simpler, but you have much more power.

But we didn't feel like play was a powerful theme on its own. We needed something with more conflict. This led us to play's natural opponent: work. And then it was clear — "work vs. play" would be a very strong theme. Stated in more detail, "Work wants to destroy play, but play must survive, because play is more important", was the truth-based theme we arrived at. Replace "work" and "play" with "slavery" and "freedom" as we did in Chapter 3, and the power of this theme becomes clear. 

The story of Toontown Online became a story of robot executives (the Cogs) trying to turn colorful Toontown into a dingy office park. It was an expression of a theme that we knew would resonate with our audience. **Resonant themes elevate your work from craft to art**. An artist is someone
who takes you where you could never go alone, and theme is the vehicle for getting there. 

Not every theme needs to be a resonant theme, of course. But when you find a deep resonant theme, it makes sense to use it for all it is worth. Some will be experience-based, others will be truth-based. You can **never tell which themes are resonant just through logic — you have to feel the resonance, deep inside yourself**. It is an important form of self-listening, and is also Lens #10.

## Back to Reality

You may think that all this talk of resonant themes is too lofty for game design. And for some games, maybe it is. Does Super Monkey Ball have a deep resonant theme? Maybe not, but it certainly does have a unifying theme which helped to drive the design. **`Resonant themes can add great power to your work, but even if your game doesn't seem to have one, it will still be strengthened by a unifying theme to focus the experience`**.

Some designers reject the notion of theme, because they say "the players will never notice." And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the theme of a work that truly moves them — and that is because **theme often operates at a subconscious level**. Players know they like a game, but they can't quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interesting or important to them.

> Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players.

Different designers use theme in different ways as part of their design process.
Now it is time for us to explore the many other aspects of the overall process of
game design.

## Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance

To use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
* If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
* I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?

The Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening
to yourself and listening to others. **We bury important things deep inside ourselves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find**.
