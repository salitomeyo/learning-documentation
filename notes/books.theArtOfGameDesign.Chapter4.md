## What Are Little Games Made Of?

If you have just been a game player up until now, you probably haven't thought too much about what a game is made of. Thinking about a videogame, you might have a vague idea that a game is this kind of story world, with some rules, and a computer program lurking around somewhere in there that somehow makes it all go.

Our study of anatomy begins with an understanding of the four basic elements that comprise every game.

## The Four Basic Elements

There are many ways to break down and classify the many elements that form a game. I have found that the categories which I call the elemental tetrad, are very useful. Let's look briefly at each of the four, and how they relate to the others:

### 1. Mechanics

These are the **procedures and rules of your game**. Mechanics **describe the goal of your game, how players can and cannot try to achieve it, and what happens when they try**. If you compare games to (books, movies, etc.), you will note that they do not involve mechanics, for it is mechanics that make a game a game. 

When you choose a set of mechanics as crucial to your gameplay, you will need to choose technology that can support them, aesthetics that emphasize them clearly to players, and a story that allows your game mechanics to make sense to the players. Mechanics will be given detailed attention in Chapters 10–12.

### 2. Story

This is **the sequence of events that unfolds in your game**. It may be linear and pre-scripted, or it may be branching and emergent. When you have a storyyou want to tell through your game, you have to **choose mechanics that will both strengthen that story and let that story emerge**. 

You will want to choose aesthetics that help reinforce the ideas of your story, and technology that is best suited to the particular story that will come out of your game. Story, and its special relationship with game mechanics, will be studied in Chapters 15 and 16.

### 3. Aesthetics

This is **how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels**. Aesthetics are an **incredibly important aspect of game design since they have the most direct relationship to a player's experience**. When you have a certain look, or tone, that you want players to experience and become immersed in, you will need to choose a technology that will not only allow the aesthetics to come through, but amplify and reinforce them. 

You will want to choose mechanics that make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined, and you will want a story with a set of events that let your aesthetics emerge at the right pace and have the most impact. The skill of choosing aesthetics that reinforce the other elements of the game to create a truly memorable experience will be examined in Chapter 20.

### 4. Technology

We are not exclusively referring to "high technology" here, but to **any materials and interactions that make your game possible** such as paper and pencil, plastic chits, or high-powered lasers. The technology you choose for your game enables it to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things.

The technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place, which the mechanics will occur, and through which the story will be told. We
will talk in detail about how to choose the right technology for your game in Chapter 26.

### Tetrad

It is important to understand that none of the elements is more important than the others. The tetrad is arranged here in a diamond shape not to show any relative importance, but only to help illustrate the "visibility gradient"; technological elements tend to be the least visible to the players, aesthetics are the most visible, and mechanics and story are somewhere in the middle. The important thing to understand about the four elements is that they are all essential.

You will make important decisions about all four elements. **Each one powerfully influences each of the others. Each has an equally powerful effect on the player's experience of your game**, and thus, each deserves equal attention. This point of view is crucial when using Lens #7.

## Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad

To use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole. Ask yourself these questions:

* Is my game design using elements of all four types?
* Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
* Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?

### Elemental Tetrad of Space Invaders

Consider the design of the game Space Invaders (Taito, 1978) by Toshihiro
Nishikado. 

* Technology: It was the first videogame that allowed a player to fight an advancing army, and this was only possible due to the custom motherboard that was created for it.
* Mechanics: The game mechanics behind Space Invaders are very solid andwell-balanced and were very innovative at the time.
* Story: It could have been an abstract game where a triangle shoots at blocks. But having a story makes it far more exciting and easier to understand. A story about advancing aliens.
* Aesthetics: The aliens are not all identical. There are three different designs, each worth a different amount of points. Colored strips of translucent plastic were glued to the screen. Audio, the marching invaders made a sort of heartbeat noise, and as they sped up, the heartbeat sped up. The cabinet for Space Invaders had a design that was attractive and eye-catching that helped tell the story of the evil alien invaders.

Part of the **key to the success of Space Invaders was that each of the four basic elements were all working hard toward the same goal** — to let the player experience the fantasy of battling an alien army. Each of the elements made compromises for the other, and clearly deficits in one element often inspired the designer to make changes in another. These are the sort of clever insights you are likely to have when you view your design through the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad.

## Skin and Skeleton

It is a wonderful thing to learn enough so that you can see past the skin of a game (the player's experience) into the skeleton (the elements that make up the game). Some designers, thinking constantly about the detailed internal workings of games, forget about the player experience. 

It is not enough to merely understand the various game elements and how they interrelate with one another — you must always consider how they relate to the experience. This is **`one of the great challenges of game design: to simultaneously feel the experience of your game while understanding which elements and elemental interactions are causing that experience, and why`**. 

If you focus only on skin, you can think about how an experience feels, but not understand why it feels that way or how to improve it. If you focus only on skeleton, you can make a game structure that is beautiful in theory, but horrible in practice. If you manage to focus on both at once, you can see how it all works while feeling the power of your game's experience at the same time.

Essentially, the skill you need to develop is the **ability to observe your own experience while thinking about the underlying causes of that experience**. This important skill is called holographic design, and it is detailed in Lens #8.

## Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design

To use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four elements and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is acceptable to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically. Ask yourself these questions:

* What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
* What elements of the game detract from the experience?
* How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

Now let's turn our attention to the reason these elements need to work together.
