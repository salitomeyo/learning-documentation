## Frame

This represent each screen of our application, its what you expect to find in your display when you enter each page of the application 

For example, a home page is one frame, a login page is another frame

> As said before make sure the `frame matches the display resolution` your app is meant to be seen in, dont use random sizes

### Frame size

It can be hard to appeal to all the different sizes your application will be used in, so we can use some of the built in sizes in figma, they accomodate to commonly used devices

We can create them by just clicking on the name of the device we want while having the frame tool selected

We can also google most common phone size or something of that sort and use that measurements

## Shape

This is a tool that help us create basic shapes, they may seem like you have little choices but all the shapes included are fully editable and customizable
