We have already discussed that ultimately, experiences are what a game designer creates. These experiences can only happen in one place — the human brain. Entertaining the human brain is hard because it is so complex — it is the most complex object in the known universe. Even worse, most of its workings are hidden from us. Until you got to this sentence, were you at all conscious of the position of your body, the rate of your breathing, or how your eyes were moving across the page? Do you even know how your eyes move across the page? Do they move smoothly and linearly, or do they take little hops? How could you have read books for so many years without being sure of the answer to that question? When you speak, do you really know what you are going to say before you say it? Incredibly, when you drive a car, somehow you observe the curvature of the roadway and translate that into a rotational angle by which you move the steering wheel. Who does that calculation? Can you even remember paying attention to the curvature of the roadway? And how does it happen that just because this sentence contains the words “imagine eating a hamburger with pickles ” that your mouth is watering right now? Consider this pattern:


? FIGURE

Somehow, you know what comes next. How did you reach that conclusion? Was
it through a process of deductive logic, or did you just “see” the answer? If you just
saw it, what did you see? And who drew the picture that you saw?
Here’s one more. Try this experiment: Find a friend, and ask them to do these
three things:
1. Say the word “boast” five times. “Boast, boast, boast, boast, boast. ”
2. Spell the word “boast” out loud. “B-O-A-S-T. ”
3. Answer this question: “What do you put in a toaster? ”
Your friend will likely give the answer “toast.” Generally, toast is what you take
out of a toaster, not what you put in. If you omit the first two steps, most people
will give a more correct answer, like “bread. ” Priming the brain’s networks with
“boast” is enough make the word “toast” seem like a better candidate than the correct answer, “bread. ” We normally think of answering a question like “What do
you put in a toaster? ” as a very conscious event, but the truth is that the subconscious exerts terrific control over almost everything we say and do. Mostly it does
that wisely and well, and we feel like “we ” are doing it — but from time to time it
makes a laughable mistake, and reveals how much control it truly has.
115
The majority of what is going on in our brains is hidden from the conscious
mind. Psychologists are gradually making progress toward understanding these subconscious processes, but generally, we are in the dark as to how they really work.
The workings of our mind are mostly outside our understanding, and mostly outside our control. But the mind is the place that game experiences happen, so we
must do what we can to get a working knowledge of what seems to be going on in
there. In Chapter 6 we talked about using the power of the creative subconscious
to be a better designer. Now we must consider the interaction of the conscious and
subconscious in the mind of the player. Everything that is known about the human
mind would fill many encyclopedias — we will contain our examination of the mind
to some of the key factors that relate to game design.
There are four principal mental abilities that make gameplay possible. These are
modeling, focus, imagination, and empathy. We will consider each in turn, and then
examine the secret priorities of every player’s subconscious mind.
 Modeling
Reality is amazingly complex. The only way our minds are able to get by at all is
by simplifying reality so that we can make some sense of it. Correspondingly, our
minds do not deal with reality itself, but instead with models of reality. Mostly we
do not notice this — the modeling takes place below our awareness. Consciousness
is an illusion that our internal experiences are reality, when in truth they are imperfect simulations of something we may never truly understand. The illusion is a very
good one, but at times we run into places where our internal simulations fail. Some
of these are visual, like this picture:
FIGURE
9.3
MODELING
In reality, those dots are not changing color as our eyes move around, but our brain
sure does make it look like they are.
Some examples don’t become clear until you think about them a little bit, such
as the visible light spectrum. From a physics point of view, visible light, infrared,
ultraviolet, and microwaves are all the same kind of electromagnetic radiation, just
at different wavelengths. Our eyes can only see a tiny fraction of this smooth spectrum, and we call this fraction visible light. It would be very useful if we could
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
116
see other kinds of light. Seeing infrared light, for example, would let us easily spot
predators in the dark, since all living things emit infrared light. Unfortunately, the
insides of our eyeballs emit infrared as well, so if we could see it, we would be
quickly blinded by our own glow. As a result, a huge amount of useful data, that
is, everything outside the visible light range of the electromagnetic spectrum, is not
part of our perceived reality.
Even the visible light we can see is strangely filtered by our eyes and brains.
Because of the construction of our eye, this spread of visible light wavelengths looks
like it falls into distinct groupings, which we call colors. When we look at a rainbow
that comes out of a prism, we can draw lines to separate one color from another. In
truth, though, this is just an artifact of the mechanics of the retina. In reality, there
is no sharp separation of colors, just a smooth gradient of wavelengths, even though
our eyes tell us that blue and light blue are much more similar than say, light blue
and green. We evolved this eye structure because breaking up the wavelengths into
groups like this is a useful way to better understand the world. “Colors ” are only an
illusion, not part of reality at all, but a very useful model of reality.
Reality is full of aspects that aren’t at all part of our day-to-day modeling. For
example, our bodies, our homes, and our food are teeming with microscopic bacteria and mites. Many are single celled, but others, such as the Demodex follicularum ,
that lives in our eyelashes, pores, and hair follicles, are almost large enough (up to
0.4 mm) to be seen with the naked eye. These tiny creatures are everywhere around
us, but are generally not part of our mental models at all, because mostly, we don’t
need to know about them.
FIGURE
9.4
One good way to get a grasp on some of our mental models is to look for things
that feel natural to us until we think about them. Consider this picture of Charlie
Brown. At first glance, nothing seems too unusual about him — he’s just a boy. But
upon reflection, he looks nothing like a real person. His head is nearly as big as his
body! His fingers are little bumps! Most distressing of all, he is made of lines. Look
around you — nothing is made of lines — everything is made of lumps. His unreality doesn’t become apparent until we stop and consciously think about it, and this
is a clue to how the brain models things.
117
Charlie Brown seems like a person even though he doesn’t look like anyone we
know because he matches some of our internal models. We accept his giant head
because our minds store much more information about heads and faces than the
rest of the body, since so much information about a person’s feelings come from
their face. If instead, he had a small head, and giant feet, he would immediately
look ridiculous, because he wouldn’t match our internal models at all.
And what about his lines? It is a challenging problem for the brain to look at a
scene and pick out which objects are separate from each other. When it does, below
our conscious level, our internal visual processing system draws lines around each
separate object. Our conscious mind never sees these lines, but it does get a feeling
about which things in a scene are separate objects. When we are presented with a
picture already drawn with lines, it has been “ pre-digested ” in a sense, matching
our internal modeling mechanisms perfectly, and saving them a lot of work. This
is part of why people find cartoons and comics so soothing to look at — our brain
needs to do less work to understand them.
Stage magicians amaze us by taking advantage of our mental models and then
breaking them. In our mind, our models are reality, so we feel like we are seeing
someone do the impossible. The audible gasp that comes from an audience at the
culmination of a magic trick is the sound of their mental models being torn asunder.
It is only through our faith that “it must be a trick ” that we are able to reason that
magicians don’t have supernatural powers.
Our brains do a tremendous amount of work to boil down the complexity of reality into simpler mental models that can be easily stored, considered, and manipulated. And this is not just the case for visual objects. It is also the case for human
relationships, risk and reward evaluation, and decision making. Our minds look at
a complex situation and try to boil it down to a simple set of rules and relationships
that we can manipulate internally.
As game designers, we care a lot about these mental models because games,
with their simple rules, are like Charlie Brown — they are pre-digested models that
we can easily absorb and manipulate. This is why they are relaxing to play — they
are less work for our brain than the real world, because so much of the complexity
has been stripped away. Abstract strategy games, like tic-tac-toe and back gammon,
are almost completely bare models. Other games, like computer-based RPGs, take
a simple model and coat it with some sugary aesthetics, so that the very act of
working to digest the model is pleasurable. This is so different from the real world,
where you have to work so hard to figure out what the rules of the game even are,
and then work even harder to achieve them, never sure if you are doing the right
thing. And this is why games can sometimes be great practice for the real world —
it is why they still teach chess at West Point — games give us practice digesting and
experimenting with simpler models, so we can work our way up to ones as complex
as the real world, and be competent at dealing with them when we are ready.
The important thing to understand is that everything we experience and think
about is a model — not reality. Reality is beyond our understanding and comprehension. All we can understand is our little model of reality. Sometimes this model
MODELING
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
118
breaks, and we have to fix it. The reality we experience is just an illusion, but this
illusion is the only reality we will ever know. As a designer, if you can understand
and control how that illusion is formed in your player’s mind, you will create experiences that feel as real, or more real, than reality itself.
 Focus
One crucial technique our brains use to make sense of the world is the ability to
focus its attention selectively, ignoring some things, and devoting more mental power
to others. The brain’s ability to do this can be startling. One example is the “cocktail
party effect, ” which is our remarkable ability to pay attention to a single conversation when a roomful of people are all talking at once. Even though the sound
waves from many conversations are hitting our ears simultaneously, we somehow
have the ability to “tune in ” one, and “tune out ” the others. To study this, psychologists have performed what are sometimes called “dichotic ear studies. ” In these
experiments, subjects wear headphones that deliver different audio experiences to
each ear. For example, a voice in a subject’s left ear might be reading Shakespeare,
and the voice in a subject’s right ear might be reading a stream of numbers.
Provided the voices are not too similar, subjects who are asked to focus on one of
the voices, and repeat back what they are hearing as they hear it, are generally able
to do so. Afterwards, when asked questions about what the other voice was saying,
subjects generally have no idea. Their brains focused only on selected information
and tuned out the rest.
What we focus on at any given moment is determined through a blend of our
unconscious desires and our conscious will. When we create games, our goal is
to create an experience interesting enough that it holds the player’s focus as long
and as intensely as possible. When something captures our complete attention and
imagination for a long period, we enter an interesting mental state. The rest of the
world seems to fall away, and we have no intrusive thoughts. All we are thinking about is what we are doing, and we completely lose track of time. This state
of sustained focus, pleasure, and enjoyment is referred to as “flow, ” and has been
the subject of extensive study by psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi and many
others. Flow is sometimes defined as “a feeling of complete and energized focus in
an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment. ” It pays for game designers to make a careful study of flow, because this is exactly the feeling we want the
players of our games to enjoy. Some of the key components necessary to create an
activity that puts a player into a flow state are
● Clear goals. When our goals are clear, we are able to more easily stay focused on
our task. When goals are unclear, we are not “into” our task, for we aren’t at all
certain whether our current actions are useful.
● No distractions. Distractions steal focus from our task. No focus, no flow.
119
● Direct feedback. If every time we take an action, we have to wait before we
know what effect the action caused, we will quickly become distracted and lose
focus on our task. When feedback is immediate, we can easily stay focused.
● Continuously challenging. Human beings love a challenge. But it must be a
challenge we think we can achieve. If we start to think we can’t achieve it, we
feel frustrated, and our minds start seeking an activity more likely to be rewarding. On the other hand, if the challenge is too easy, we feel bored, and again, our
minds start seeking more rewarding activities.
Flow activities must manage to stay in the narrow margin of challenge that lies
between boredom and frustration, for both of these unpleasant extremes cause our
mind to change its focus to a new activity. Csikszentmihalyi calls this margin the
“flow channel. ” He gives an example of the flow channel, using, not surprisingly, a
game.
Let us assume that the figure below represents a specific activity — for example,
the game of tennis. The two theoretically most important dimensions of the
experience, challenges and skills, are represented on the two axes of the diagram. The letter A represents Alex, a boy who is learning to play tennis. The
diagram shows Alex at four different points in time. When he first starts playing (A 1), Alex has practically no skills, and the only challenge he faces is hitting the ball over the net. This is not a very difficult feat, but Alex is likely to
enjoy it because the difficulty is just right for his rudimentary skills. So at this
point he will probably be in flow. But he cannot stay there long. After a while,
if he keeps practicing, his skills are bound to improve, and then he will grow
bored just batting the ball over the net (A 2). Or it might happen that he meets
a more practiced opponent, in which case he will realize that there are much
harder challenges for him than just lobbing the ball — at that point, he will feel
some anxiety (A 3) concerning his poor performance.

120
Neither boredom nor anxiety are positive experiences, so Alex will be motivated
to return to the flow state. How is he to do it? Glancing again at the diagram,
we see that if he is bored (A 2) and wishes to be in flow again, Alex has essentially only one choice: to increase the challenges he is facing. (He also has a
second choice, which is to give up tennis altogether — in which case A would
simply disappear from the diagram.) By setting himself a new and more difficult goal that matches his skills — for instance, to beat an opponent just a little
more advanced that he is — Alex would be back in flow (A 4).
If Alex is anxious (A 3), the way back to flow requires that he increase his skills.
Theoretically he could also reduce the challenges he is facing, and thus return
to the flow where he started (in A 1), but in practice it is difficult to ignore challenges once one is aware that they exist.
The diagram shows that both A 1 and A 4 represent situations in which Alex is
in flow. Although both are equally enjoyable, the two states are quite different
in that A 4 is a more complex experience than A 1. It is more complex because it
involves greater challenges, and demands greater skill from the player.
But A 4, although complex and enjoyable, does not represent a stable situation
either. As Alex keeps playing, either he will become bored by the stale opportunities he finds at that level, or he will become anxious and frustrated by his
relatively low ability. So the motivation to enjoy himself again will push him
to get back into the flow channel, but now at a level of complexity even higher
than A 4 .
It is this dynamic feature that explains why flow activities lead to growth and
discovery. Once cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long.
We grow either bored or frustrated; and then the desire to enjoy ourselves again
pushes us to stretch our skills, or to discover new opportunities for using them.
You can see how keeping someone in the flow channel is a delicate balance, for
a player’s skill level seldom stays in one place. As their skill increases, you must
present them with commensurate challenges. For traditional games, this challenge
primarily comes from seeking out more challenging opponents. In videogames,
there is often a sequence of levels that gradually get more challenging. This pattern of levels of increasing difficulty is nicely self-balancing — players with a lot
of skill can usually move through the lower levels quickly, until they come to the
levels that challenge them. This connection between skill and the speed of finishing a level helps keep skilled players from getting bored. However, it is the rare
player who is persistent enough to win the game, mastering all levels. Most players
eventually reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that
they give up on the game. There is much debate about whether that is a bad thing
(many players are frustrated) or a good thing (since only skilled, persistent players
can reach the end, the accomplishment is special).
121
This will probably feel much more interesting to a player. It is a repeating cycle
of increasing challenge, followed by a reward, often of more power, which gives
an easier period of less challenge. Soon enough, the challenge ramps up again. For
example, a videogame might feature a gun that lets me destroy enemies if I shoot
them three times. As I proceed through the game, the enemies grow more numerous, increasing the challenge. If I rise to the challenge, though, and defeat enough
enemies, I might be rewarded with a gun that lets me destroy the enemies with only
two shots. Suddenly the game is easier, which is very rewarding. This easy period

FOCUS
Many designers are quick to point out that while staying in the flow channel is
important, some ways of moving up the channel are better than others. Moving
straight up the channel, like this …
 …is definitely better than the game ending in anxiety or boredom. But consider
the play experience that follows a track more like this:
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
122
doesn’t last though, because soon new enemies that take three and even four shots
to destroy, even with my new gun, will start to appear, taking the challenge to new
heights.
This cycle of “tense and release, tense and release ” comes up again and again
in design. It seems to be inherent to human enjoyment. Too much tension, and we
wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When we fluctuate between
the two, we enjoy both excitement and relaxation, and this oscillation also provides
both the pleasure of variety, and the pleasure of anticipation.
You can see how useful the idea of flow and the flow channel can be for discussing and analyzing a gameplay experience — so useful that it is Lens #18.
 Lens #18: The Lens of Flow
To use this lens, consider what is holding your player’s focus.
Ask yourself these questions:
● Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
● Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
● Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget
their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game
goals?
● Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard challenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually
improving?
● Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I
change that?
Flow is a very hard thing to test for. You won’t see it in ten minutes of gameplay.
You must observe players for longer periods. Even trickier, a game that keeps someone in flow the first few times they play it may later become boring or frustrating.
When observing a player, flow can be easy to miss — you must learn to recognize it. It is not always accompanied by external expressions of emotion — it often
involves quiet withdrawal. Players in flow playing solo games will often be quiet,
possibly muttering to themselves. They are so focused that they are sometimes slow
to respond or irritated if you ask them questions. Players in flow during multiplayer
games will sometimes communicate with one another enthusiastically, constantly
focused on the game. Once you notice a player going into flow during your game,
you need to watch them closely — they won’t stay there forever. You must watch
for that crucial moment — the event that moves them out of the flow channel, so
123
you can figure how to make sure that event doesn’t happen in your next prototype
of the game.
One final note: don’t forget to turn the Lens of Flow on yourself! You will surely
find that times of flow are when you get the most done as a designer — make sure
to organize your design time so you can get to that special state of mind as frequently as possible.
 Empathy
As human beings, we have an amazing ability to project ourselves into the place of
others. When we do this, we think the other person’s thoughts and feel their feelings, to the best of our ability. It is one of the hallmarks of our ability to understand
one another that we can do this, and it is an integral part of gameplay.
There is an interesting theater exercise where a group of actors is divided into
two groups. In the first group, each actor chooses an emotion (happiness, sadness,
anger, etc.), and then they all mill about the stage, each trying to project their chosen emotion through attitude, walk, and facial expression. The second group does
not choose an emotion. They just walk about at random among the first group,
trying to establish eye contact with others. The first time they try this, the actors
in the second group discover themselves doing something shocking — whenever
they make eye contact with someone projecting an emotion, they take on the emotion themselves, and make the corresponding facial expression, without consciously
willing to do so.
This is how strong our power of empathy can be. Without even trying, we
become other people. When we see someone who is happy, we can feel their
joy as if it is our own. When we see someone who is sad, we can feel their pain.
Entertainers use our power of empathy to make us feel we are part of the storyworld they are creating. Amazingly, our empathy can be cast from one person to
another in the blink of an eye. We can even empathize with animals.
Have you noticed that dogs have much richer facial expression than other animals? They express emotion with their eyes and eyebrows much like we do (Figure
9.8). Wolves (dog ancestors) don’t have nearly the range of facial expression of
domesticated dogs. Dogs appear to have evolved this ability as a survival skill. Dogs
that could make the right faces could capture our empathy, and we, suddenly feeling their feelings, became more likely to take care of them.
Of course, the brain does all this using mental models — in truth, we are empathizing not with real people or animals, but with our mental models of them —
which means we are easily tricked. We can feel emotion when there is none.
A photo, a drawing, or a videogame character can just as easily capture our
empathy. Cinematographers understand this, and they fling our empathy all over the
place, from one character to another, thus manipulating our feelings and emotions.
Next time you watch television, pay attention, moment to moment, about where
your empathy is going, and why it is going there.
EMPATHY
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
124
As game designers, we will make use of empathy in the same ways that novelists, graphic artists, and filmmakers do, but we also have our own set of new
empathic interactions. Games are about problem solving, and empathic projection is a useful method of problem solving. If I can imagine myself in the place
of another, I can make better decisions about what that person can do to solve a
particular problem. Also, in games, you don’t just project your feelings into a character, you project your entire decision-making capacity into that character, and can
become them in a way that isn’t possible in non-interactive media. We will discuss
the implications of this in detail in Chapter 18.
 Imagination
Imagination puts the player into the game by putting the game into the player
(Figure 9.9).
You might think, when I talk about the power of the player’s imagination, that I
might mean their creative imagination, and the power to make up dreamlike fantasy
worlds — but I am talking about something much more mundane. The imagination
I’m talking about is the miraculous power that everyone takes for granted — the
everyday imagination that every person uses for communication and problem solving. For example, if I tell you a short story: “The mailman stole my car yesterday, ” I
have actually told you very little, but already you have a picture of what happened.
FIGURE
9.8
125
Weirdly, your picture is full of details that I didn’t include in my story. Take a look
at the mental image that formed, and answer these questions:
● What did the mailman look like?
● What kind of neighborhood was my car in when he stole it?
● What color was the car?
● What time of day did he steal it?
● How did he steal it?
● Why did he steal it?
Now, I didn’t tell you any of those things, but your amazing imagination just
made up a bunch of these details so that you could more easily think about what I
was telling you. Now, if I suddenly give you more information, like, “It wasn’t a real
car, but an expensive model toy car, ” you quickly reformulate your imaginary image
to fit what you have heard, and your answers to the above questions might change
correspondingly. This ability to automatically fill in gaps is very relevant for game
design, for it means that our games don’t need to give every detail, and players
will be able to fill in the rest. The art comes in knowing what you should show the
player, and what you should leave to their imagination.
This power, when you think about it, is quite incredible. The fact that our brains
only deal in simplified models of reality means that we can manipulate these
models effortlessly, sometimes into situations that wouldn’t be possible in reality. I
can see an armchair and imagine what it would look like if it were a different color,
a different size, if it was made of oatmeal, or if it was walking around. We do a lot
of problem solving this way. If I ask you to find a way to change a light bulb without a stepladder, you immediately start imagining possible solutions.
FIGURE
9.9
IMAGINATION
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
126
 Imagination has two crucial functions: the first is communication (often for
storytelling), and the second is problem solving. Since games prominently feature
both of these, game designers must understand how to engage the player’s imagination as a storytelling partner, as well as having a sense of the problems it will
and will not be able to solve.
 Motivation
We have now examined four of the key mental abilities that make gameplaying possible: modeling, focus, empathy, and imagination. Let’s now consider why the brain
is motivated to use any of these at all.
In 1943, psychologist Abraham Maslow wrote a paper titled “A Theory of
Human Motivation, ” which proposed a hierarchy of human needs. This is often
presented as a pyramid:
SelfActualization
Pursue Inner Talent
Creativity · Fullfilment
Belonging-Love
Self-Esteem
Achievement · Mastery
Recognition · Respect
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
Safety
Security · Stability · Freedom from Fear
Friends · Family · Spouse · Lover
Physiological
Food · Water · Shelter · Warmth
FIGURE
9.10
The idea here is that people are not motivated to pursue the higher level needs
on this list until the lower needs are satisfied. For example, if someone is starving
to death, this is a priority over a feeling of safety. If someone doesn’t feel safe, they
aren’t going to seriously pursue human relationships. If someone doesn’t feel love
and social belonging, they aren’t going to pursue things that will boost their selfesteem. And if they don’t have good self-esteem, they will not be able to pursue
their talents (remember the major gift?) to do what they were “born to do. ”
If you think hard, you can come up with some possible exceptions to this model,
but overall, it works well enough to be a very useful tool for discussing player’s
127
motivations in games. It is interesting to think about different game activities, and
where they fall on this hierarchy. Many game activities are about achievement and
mastery, which places them at level four, self-esteem. But some are lower. Looking
at the hierarchy, the reasons for the appeal and staying power of multiplayer games
suddenly becomes clear — they fulfill more basic needs than single player gameplay,
so it shouldn’t be surprising that many players will feel more motivated to do them.
Can you think of gameplay activities that go even farther down on the hierarchy,
to the second or first levels? How about activities on the fifth level?
Any game that connects you with other people, lets you feel a sense of accomplishment, and lets you build and create things that let you express yourself fulfills
needs on the third, fourth, and fifth levels. Viewed from this perspective, the popularity and staying power of games with both online communities and content creation tools makes a lot of sense. It is also interesting to consider how the different
levels can feed into one another.
This needs-based perspective on game design is Lens #19.
 Judgment
The fourth level of Maslow’s hierarchy, self-esteem, is the one most intimately connected to games. But why? One deep need common to everyone is the need to be
JUDGMENT
 Lens #19: The Lens of Needs
To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about what
basic human needs it fulfills.
Ask yourself these questions:
● On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?
● How can I make my game fulfill more basic needs than it already is?
● On the levels my game is currently operating, how can it fulfill those needs
even better?
It sounds strange to talk about a game fulfilling basic human needs, but everything that people do is an attempt to fulfill these needs in some way. And keep
in mind, some games fulfill needs better than others — your game can’t just
promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. If a player imagines
that playing your game is going to make them feel better about themselves, or
get to know their friends better, and your game doesn’t deliver on these needs,
your player will move on to a game that does.
CHAPTER NINE • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
128
 Lens #20: The Lens of Judgment
To decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these
questions:
● What does your game judge about the players?
● How does it communicate this judgment?
● Do players feel the judgment is fair?
● Do they care about the judgment?
● Does the judgment make them want to improve?
The human mind is truly the most fascinating, amazing, complex thing that we
know. We may never unravel all of its mysteries. The more we know about it, the
better a chance we’ll have of creating a great experience in it, for it is the site where
all our game experiences take place. And never forget! You are equipped with one
yourself. You can use your own powers of modeling, focus, empathy, and imagination to get to know how these powers are being used in the mind of your player. In
