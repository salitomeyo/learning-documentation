## Importance of typography

It gives us an understanding on how to convey design as a whole, the typography should be selected in order to convey the same feelings the rest of the UI is conveying on its own

Typography makes up 95% of most web applications

## Basic Terminology

* **Typeface** it the overall art work, arial, times new roman are typefaces

* **Fonts** are files that allows us to use specific typefaces inside devices

* **Typography** is the art behind the decisions that we make when using the typeface, when to use it, how to use it

* **Glyph** is each individual symbol in a font file, each letter is a glyph, each number is a glyph as well

## Web Typography

Is not the same as print typography, there are some restrictions

* Make sure the font you are using is not overloading the application
* Only use fonts you have web licenses for
* Be aware of browsers web engines and how it can affect the font
* The user can somewhat change the size of the letters
* We have to use a typography that will accommodate to multiple device sizes
* We need to have fall back plans in case something doesnt load or our user has bad connection

> Web browsers can never be trusted

### Web trypographers

Create a typography design system before any copy has even been written

You will need to create a typographic system rather than take existing content and laying it out, and be sure it can be applied to different scenarios

## Non-Verbal Communication

On an study run by Albert Mehrabian he concluded that our communication is based

* 55% on visual information
* 38% on the voice
* 7% on the actual word displayed

But we have to be aware this study was made in order to figure out how much emotion was communicated in single words not how much information so the can be a bit misleading in a real world scenario

But even taking this study with a grain of salt we have to remember

> A large amount of communication is nonverbal and a large amount of that nonverbal communication is emotional

So we need to **make good typographic choices to make the reader trust our company and feel an emotional connection**

On the other hand studies have shown that people remember visuals better than words, which means **if we want users to remember our words we need to give them a good visual feeling** with out typography 

The is something bold and confident about a brand who chooses typography with lots of character, because they are subconsciously putting part of their personality in the decision, and that little part of their personality cannot be a lie, whereas the words they use are probably a lie

> We can learn far more about an author from reading their fictional pieces that their nonfictional ones, and far more about a brand from their typography choices than from the words they write

## Anatomy of Typography

* **Height**: the overall height of the glyphs which means the height from the highest ascender to the lower descender glyphs

* **Cap height**: The height of the biggest capital letter

![](/assets/images/UI/font-cap-height.png){max-width: 600px}

* **x-height**: The height of the lower case letters without including the ascenders and descenders

![](/assets/images/UI/font-x-height.png){max-width: 600px}

* **Ascenders and descenders**: Are the bits that stick out of the x-height in the lower case letters

![](/assets/images/UI/font-ascenders-descenders.png){max-width: 600px}

* **Stroke**: Are the lines that make the letter, changing the stroke width will change the boldness of the letter

* **Stem**: The main vertical line on a letter

* **Crossbar** or **Bar**: Horizontal lines on a letter

* **Spine**: Letters where the main stroke is curved

* **Bowl**: The rounded areas on a letter

* **Counter**: The area enclosed by the bowl which can be either closed or open

* **Serif**: The little feet we can see in the letters in some specific fonts

* **Terminal**: The ending of a letter that doesnt have serif

* **Overshoot**: A serif that increases the width of the letter

* **Arm**: Diagonal line that sticks up from a letter

* **Leg**: Diagonal line that sticks down from a letter

* **Shoulder**: Rounded upper right portion of the letter

* **Tail**: A line that sticks out of the bottom of the letter

* **Swash**: Decorative lines that some fonts add to the letters but that dont convey any meaning to the understanding of the letter

## Printing Press

Invented in china, was not quite useful because of the chinese alphabet that has far too many characters for it to be useful, it was then adquired by europe where it was for more useful

In Europe in that time books usually used a typhography called `Black Letter` which is quite decorative and hard to reduce the size of the letters without affecting the readability which created quite a dilemma using that typeface for the printing press was hard

**Nicolas Jenson created a solution inventing a typeface that looked good even in small size making this typeface the default for printing press**

But this caused another issue the typeface was quite monotonous for the era customed to reading books written by hand where nothing is quite as perfect, to fix this **they created little modifications to each letter** so the books printed in that time you will see that the same letter has multiple variations **to appear more "humanistics"**

And they created slightly different variations for different sizes of the letters 

## Typefaces History

### Serif Typefaces

* **Old-Style Serifs**: Like Jenson or Garamond
* **Transitional Serifs**: Like Baskerville
* **Modern Serifs**: Like Didot or Bodoni

The modern serifs have more contrast against the line widths while the old style wanted to appear more humanistic

New typefaces dont fit into this 3 classifications so easily

### Sans-Serif Typefaces

Avant garde **artist wanted to reject everything that came before them and create simpler designs**, this transformed the letters and remove everything that distracted from the meaning thus removing the serifs

In 1927 Paul Renner created Futura entirely made of geometric shapes and easy to read but he was located in germany and when the world broke down nazis appropiated the Black Letter while the rest of the world adopted Futura

After the war Helvetica was created, this is the most used typeface in the world

When the **era of computers came by the sans serif became the go to typeface because they where easy to render** in early monitors introducing typefaces like Verdana, and Arial 

When the **computers started having better monitors the sans serif became outdated and many other typefaces started to pop out**, like Gotham and classification of typefaces became much less important
