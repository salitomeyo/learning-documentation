Colors depend on the context, you cant understand colors without taking into account the environment they will be subject to, but this doesnt mean color theory is irrelevant, **color theory will help us make choices and give reason behind those choices**

## One color

**Colors can look completely different to the same color depending on where that color is**

If you put for example a base color and surround it by a lighter color and next to use use the same base color but surround it with a darker color the base color on the lighter background will look darker

Try to make the same color look as different as possible

## Two colors

On the same note completely different colors can look exactly the same depending on their surroundings

Try to make two different colors look the same

## Transpose colors

See if you can convert different shades of one color and transpose them into a different color

## Transparency

Take a color background in imagine superponing the background color with another color with some sort of transparency

Try to image the color that could be created in this superposition and fill a new element with this colors, how well do they match to the actual color on the overlay

Use the same two colors and imagine what happens when each of them is on the front

## Transparency range

Create 3 elements with the same color superposing a one color background, imagine the color this superposition will create if you used different transparencies

## Color composition

**Sample a 5 colors color palette and create a balanced composition** that is completely filled with just those 5 colors

Balance the ratios of colors depending on how powerfull they appear creating columns or colors

Create a different balanced composition using different rows and columns of circles and change the background color and see how the balance changes
