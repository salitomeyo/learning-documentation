Creating great experiences is indeed our goal. But we cannot manipulate them directly. What a game designer can control is the game. **The game is your clay, and you will shape it and mold it to create all kinds of fabulous game experiences**.

So, what kind of games are we talking about? In this book, we mean all kinds of games. The same principles of design apply to all of them. What is it that these games have in common? How do we define “game”?

## A Rant About Definitions

I want to be clear about why we should seek a game definition. We all know what we are talking about when we say game and there is nothing wrong with people having their own personal opinions about the proper definition of game, and what is or is not really a game.

Some people view the lack of standardized definitions in the world of game design as "a crisis". How do we get by without a standardized vocabulary? **When there is ambiguity, simply explain what we mean**. It requires designers to stop and explain what they mean, this pause for clarification often saves time in the long run.

Would it be best if there was some centralized dictionary of standard terms on issues of game design? It would certainly be convenient, but not necessary. **Sometimes having to stop and think about what we mean, and what we are trying to say may make us better designers**.

Further, a dictionary would hardly be a gold standard as technologies change, they force us to reconsider, redefine and create new terms so the process of definition and redefinition continues indefinitely.

Game designers follow their gut instincts and feelings about what makes a good or a bad game, and sometimes have difficulty articulating what exactly makes a design good or bad. **Is important is to state clearly what you mean when you say a design is good or bad, and how it can improve**. It is not a matter of knowing the vocabulary of game design.

Defining things forces you to think about them clearly, concisely, and analytically. Having a list of terms and their definitions would teach you little. **Embarking on the journey of trying to define these terms will teach you a great deal and strengthen your ability to think about design, even though the definitions you end up with may
prove imperfect**. For this reason you may find this chapter offers you more questions than it does answers. But that's okay: the goal of this book is to make you a better designer, and a good designer must think.

### What Is a Game?

A game is something you play. But it doesn't tell us very much. A game different than a toy? A toy is something you play with. But you can play with friends and they are not toys. A toy is an object you play with. I might play with a roll of tape. Does that make it a toy? Technically, yes, but probably not a very good one. Anything you play with could be classified as a toy. 

What makes for a good toy? A good toy is an object that is fun to play with. But what do we mean when we say "fun?" Do we simply mean pleasure, or enjoyment? Fun is pleasure with surprises. **It is strange how you can use a word your whole life, and know for certain what it means, but not be able to express it clearly when asked**. 

A good way to test definitions is to come up with counterexamples. Can you think of things that are fun, but not pleasurable, or fun, but don't involve some feeling of surprise? Conversely, can you think of things that are pleasurable and have surprises but aren't fun? Surprise and fun are such important parts of every game design that they become our next two lenses.

## Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise

Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to **remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises.** Ask yourself these questions:

* What will surprise players when they play my game?
* Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment, it's at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. Brain scans revealed that even during
unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.

---

## Lens #3: The Lens of Fun

Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game's fun, ask yourself these questions:

* What parts of my game are fun? Why?
* What parts need to be more fun?

How does work can suddenly be redefined as a kind of play? The answer seems to be a change in the reason he is doing the activity. He is no longer
doing it for someone else, he is now doing it for his own personal reasons. 

> Work and play… become equivalent to servitude and freedom - Santayana

When we work, we do it because we are obligated to. Some of this servitude is willing servitude, but it is servitude nonetheless. We are doing it because we have to, not because "we feel like it". **The more obligated you are to do something, the more it feels like work. The less obligated you are to do something, the more it feels like play**. Stated differently.

> It is an invariable principle of all play… that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play cannot play.

When trying to define things about human activity, it can be useful to pay less attention to the activity itself, and more attention to the thoughts and feelings that motivate the activity. Play involves willful action, usually a willful action, manipulating something. So, one possible definition would be: **Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity**. 

---

## Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity

Think about the player's true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those
goals. Ask yourself these questions:

* What questions does my game put into the player's mind?
* What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
* What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

---

## No, Seriously, What Is a Game?

Lets look at some definitions

> Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest between powers, confined by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome. – Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith

* **"An exercise of voluntary control systems"**: Entered willfully.
* **"A contest of powers"**: Two or more things striving for dominance. Some single-player games don't always feel this way, but this phrase gets across two things: games have goals, and games have conflict.
* **"Confined by rules"**: Games have rules. Toys do
not have rules.
* **"A disequilibrial outcome"**: Disequilibrial is an interesting word. It does not simply mean "unequal", it instead implies that at one time there was equilibrium, but that it was then lost. If you play, you either win or lose.

So this definition points out some key qualities important to games.
* Q1. Games are entered willfully.
* Q2. Games have goals.
* Q3. Games have conflict.
* Q4. Games have rules.
* Q5. Games can be won and lost.

Let's consider another definition:

> [A game is] an interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires players to struggle toward a goal. – Greg Costikyan

* **"An interactive structure"**: The player is active, and not passive, and that the player and game interact with one another
* **"Struggle toward a goal"**: Again, we see the idea of a goal, and struggle implies some kind of conflict. Implies challenge. Trying not just to define what makes a game, but what makes a good game. Bad games have little challenge, or too much challenge. Good games have just the right amount.
* **"Endogenous meaning**": Means caused by factors inside the organism or system or internally generated. Things that have value inside the game have value only inside the game. The more compelling a game is, the greater the "endogenous value" that is created within the game. 

Endogenous value is such a useful perspective that it becomes Lens #5.

---

## Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value

To use this lens, think about your players' feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:

* What is valuable to the players in my game?
* How can I make it more valuable to them?
* What is the relationship between value in the game and the player's motivations?

---

Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.

Costikyan's definition gives us three new qualities that we can add to our list:

* Q6. Games are interactive.
* Q7. Games have challenge.
* Q8. Games can create their own internal value.

Let's consider one more definition of game:

> A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict, and resolves in an unequal outcome. – Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman

* **"Engages players"**: It is a good point that players find games to be engaging, that is, they make players feel "mentally immersed". Technically, we might argue this is a quality of good games, though not all games, but it is an important point.
* **"A closed, formal system"**: This implies a lot of things. "System" means games are made of interrelated elements that work together. "Formal" the system is clearly defined, that is, it has rules. "Closed" means that there are boundaries to the system. 

Johan Huizinga called it **the magic circle**, when we are mentally "in the game" we have very different thoughts, feelings, and values than when we are "out of the game". How can games, which are nothing more than sets of rules, have this magical effect on us? To understand, we have to look to the human mind.

Let's review the list of game qualities we have picked out of these various definitions:

* Q1. Games are entered willfully.
* Q2. Games have goals.
* Q3. Games have conflict.
* Q4. Games have rules.
* Q5. Games can be won and lost.
* Q6. Games are interactive.
* Q7. Games have challenge.
* Q8. Games can create their own internal value.
* Q9. Games engage players.
* Q10. Games are closed, formal systems.

> If you've written a software subroutine that takes more than ten arguments, look again. You probably missed a few - Alan Kay

If you need a long list to convey what you mean, you should find a better way to regroup your ideas. It does seem odd that something as simple, compelling, and innate to us as the playing of games would require such an unwieldy definition.

**Instead of focusing on how games relate to people, perhaps we should look from the other direction: How do people relate to games? What is it that people like so much about games?** People give many answers but there is one answer that people often give when they talk about playing games, which seems to apply to all games: "I like solving problems".

Normally, we think of problems as something negative. But we really do get pleasure from solving them and we are really good at it. The enjoyment of problem solving seems to be an evolved survival mechanism. People who enjoy solving problems are going to solve more problems, and probably get better at solving problems, and be more likely to survive.

**Any game with a goal effectively has presented you with a problem to solve**. Examples might be:

* Find a way to get more points than the other team.
* Find a way to get to the finish line before the other players.
* Find a way to complete this level.
* Find a way to destroy the other player before he destroys you.

Another possible objection one might raise is that not every activity associated with gameplaying is a problem-solving activity. Often, the things people enjoy most about games, such as social interaction or physical exercise, have nothing to do with problem solving. But **while these other activities might improve a game, they are not essential to the game. When problem solving is removed from a game, it ceases to be a game and becomes just an activity**.

So, if all games involve some kind of problem solving, and problem solving is one of the things that defines us as a species, perhaps we should look more closely at the mental mechanisms we use for problem solving to see if they have anything to do with the properties of games.

## Problem Solving 101

Let's consider what we do when we solve a problem and how it might relate to our numbered list of game qualities.

1. State the problem we are trying to solve, that is, define a clear goal (Q2).
2. Frame the problem. We determine its boundaries and the nature of the problem space. We also determine what methods we are allowed to use to solve the problem; that is, we determine the rules of the problem (Q4). 
3. Set up an internal, minimized, simplified version of reality that only includes the necessary interrelationships needed to solve the problem. This is like a cleaner, smaller version of the real-world situation, which we can more easily consider and manipulate, or interact with (Q6). 
4. Establishing a closed, formal system (Q10) with a goal. 
5. Work to reach that goal, which is usually challenging (Q7), because it involves some kind
of conflict (Q3). 
6. If we care about the problem, we quickly become engaged (Q9) in solving it. We kind of forget about the real world, since we are focused on our internal problem space. Elements in the problem space quickly gain an internal importance, if they get us closer to our goal of solving the problem, and this importance does not need to be relevant outside the context of the problem (Q8).
7. Defeat the problem, or are defeated by it, thus winning or losing (Q5).

### The magic circle 

**Is our internal problem solving system**. This does not make it any less magical. Somehow, **`our minds have the ability to create miniature realities based on the real world. These micro-realities have so effectively distilled the essential elements of reality for a particular problem that manipulations of this internal world, and conclusions drawn from it, are valid and
meaningful in the real world`**. 

Could our definition of game possibly be this simple: A game is a problem-solving activity. It might be a true statement, but it is too broad. There are lots of problem-solving activities that are not play. Many of them feel more like work. Many of them are work. But we've already determined that the difference between a play and work has nothing is the motivation for doing the activity.

Games cannot simply be problem-solving activities. One who plays them must also have that special, hard-to-define attitude that we consider essential to the nature of play. So, a definition that nicely covers all ten qualities might be:

> A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.

Whether you accept this definition or not, viewing your game as a problem to be solved is a useful perspective, and that perspective is Lens #6.

---

## Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving

To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to succeed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these
questions:

* What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
* Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
* How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?

---

## Conclusion - The Fruits of Our Labors

Let's review what we came up with:

* Fun is pleasure with surprises.
* Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.
* A toy is an object you play with.
* A good toy is an object that is fun to play with.
* A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.

You might not even agree with these definitions, if that's the case, it means you are thinking. So, keep thinking! See if you can come up with better examples than what I have here. **The whole point of defining these terms is gain new insights**
