The shortcuts are keys combination that help us make things faster

## Movement

* **Space**: Holding down the space bar turns our mouse into a hand tool that help us easily move around


## Other shortcuts

* **Ctrl + D**: Lets us duplicate a selected element
* **K**: or selecting the dropdown menu with the arrow pointer in to top left tool menu and change it to *scale* this will help us scale everything selected equivalently instead of scaling based on each selected item

## Agroupating

### Group

* **Ctrl + G**: Group, it help us agrupate various selected objects together in a single element, for example a shape and a text to create a button

### Frame

* **Ctrl+Alt+G**: Frame, it help us agrupate various selected object togethe in a single element, for example a shape and a text to create a button

`So whats the difference?` Frames have all the capabilities of a group and extra ones, so its more common and better to use frames

* Frames are able to survive on their on, which means even if you eliminate all the elements that compone it it will still exist an empty frame (groups disappear if all their elements disappear)
* Frames can clip elements, which means we can use it as a mask to occult elements or cut them (elements from a group can't be left out, if we make it smaller if will scale all its elements in order to fit them)
* Frames allows us to stick elements to parts of the frame, for example if we stick an icon to the top right of the corner it will do anything to stay in that position no matter how the frame size changes (we can't stick elements to positions in groups)

## Shapes

* **Shift**: While creating a shape help us create perfect shapes for example squares instead of rectangles, and circles instead of ovals
* **Alt**: Help us activate only one of the effects in the corner of our shapes, for example only rounding one corner of a rectangle

> To activate the effects we need to be close enough to a shape and hover it, the little circles inside the shape are the effects

* **I**: Help us easily access the color picker to change colors of our selected object to other objects on screen
* **Set default properties**: While we have and object selected to which we made transformations we want to keep using we con go to the figma logo on the left top side and then click edit > set default properties, this will change the default of the shape to the one we have selected
* **Copy and paste properties**: if we have a shape already styled and we want to use the same style in other shapes we can go to *figma logo > edit > copy properties* and the click the shape we want to copy the styles to and go to figma *logo > edit > paste properties*

## Lines

* **Shift**: Holding down shift while creating a line help us create straight lines, in 0 degrees, 90, 180 etc

## Icons

Figmas has a lot of capabilities to create and edit icons, if they are in the right format, for easy edit you can download and import any icon in *svg* 

We can find icons inside figma going to the resources tool on the top menu and search for icons or we can download them from any place and import them on our files

One of the best places to find icons is [Icon finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
