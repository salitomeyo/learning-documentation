Its a `low fidelity` design that aims to validate the content, usability and workflow of a piece of software

Its usually `grayscale`, because we want users to react to the content and workflow rather than colors and illustrations. And it makes it easier for users to give honest feedback because it doesn't look like you invested a lot of time in it

It shouldn't require too much time, and shouldn't be fully detailed because we may be wrong, it's not validated and we need it to be easy to  `iterate` 

## Do's

* Have just the right amount of fidelity
* Does not have fake copy (lorem ipsum)
* Uses real photos and quick icons when needed
* Highlights the content
* Validates the work-flow and interaction model
* Has good placement for the user location (pagination)
* Uses good design patterns and device paradigms
* Gets into the details and validated micro interactions

## Don't

* Looks like a final product
* Uses fake copy
* Just uses gray squares to indicate photos
* Looks sloppy and not structured
* Everything is a 1-off and no re-use of model material
* The user has no idea of location
* Interaction details are not mapped with logic
* Does just hi-level and doesn't account for details

## Software

There are multiple softwares used to create wireframes and clickable prototypes, but the most common ones are

* **Adobe XD**
* **Figma**
