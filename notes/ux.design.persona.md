## What is The Persona?

Is a design artifact that represents a large market of people that have the same problems, goals, motivations and behaviours. Its constructed from assumptions before research and after research is revisited and updated with validated learnings

The **goal** is to capture validated context, problems, behaviours/activities, needs/goals and motivations in one design called persona

## Why are Personas important?

* Automatically introduces user centered design
* Keeps conversations user focused and not solution/opinion focused
* Reminds us daily that we are not the users, so we make assumptions about users 1st
* Help us identify users when out in the wild
* Makes it easy to introduce the user during meeting, demos and stakeholder pop-ins
* Acts as a "medium" to resolve questions, opinions in conflict, and keeps us user focused

## How to validate the persona

1. Create an unvalidated persona (make assumptions)
2. Create learning goals
3. Create questions to achieve learning goals
4. Do research 
5. Do synthesis and clustering of themes
6. Validate or invalidate the assumptions
7. Validate or invalidate the goals, needs and behaviour
8. Revisit and update the persona with the validations

## How to create a Persona

We use a simple template (is not mandatory to use the following example) that allows us to write down personal information, behaviours/activities and needs and goals

We have to fill the template in such a way that the persona we are creating can represent a nich of real people in the real world, me fill everything with real information of the assumptions we have about our user, almost like creating a social media profile 

> Its common to have multiple personas for every application
