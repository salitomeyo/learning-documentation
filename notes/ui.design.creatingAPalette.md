## Color Specifications

There is different ways to reference color

* HEX
* HSL
* RGB

Deciding in which specification to describe your colors is up to you and it wont change the colors but there is advantages to using diffent reference systems

* HEX takes up less space but is not really intuitive
* HSL it more intuive it describes 3 values hue saturation and lightness, it also lets us find colors with similar importance if we keep the Saturation and lightness the same while changing the hues, and its also easy to find constrasting colors just removing 180 to the Hue number

## Color Harmonies

* **Complementary colors** are colors that are complete opposites on the color wheel
* **Triadic colors** are equidistant colors on the color wheel
* **Split complementary** there is one principal colors and 2 other colors that have the same degrees away from the color
* **Tetradic colors** are two sets of complementary colors

> Note: We dont want to choose colors that are completely harmonic because it looks a bit too perfect 

## Emotions

Color psychology usually uses meanings that are deceptively vague, they crossover and they are not great, that doesnt mean they have no meaning but the **meaning depends on the context** not on a chard

**Color choices are statement but every color can convey a different statement** depending on the whole piece

We can **train ourselves to perceive the emotion on the colors**, sometimes is hard to figure out what the right color is without context but its easy to figure out when a color inside a compositions is out of place 

Think of contrasting adjectives and try to find colors that could describe those adjetives

Then try to find colors that express contrasting adjetives without changing the hue of the color
