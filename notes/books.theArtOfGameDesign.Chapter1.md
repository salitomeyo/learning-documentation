Magic Words: Say them out loud, "I'm a game designer". 

You might feel that you aren't really a game designer yet, but that you're just pretending to be one. And that's fine, because, people become what they pretend to be. Just go on pretending, doing the things you think a game designer would do, and before long, to your surprise, you will find you are one. 

It is terribly important that you get good at building your confidence, for doubts about your abilities will forever plague you. When a thing must be attempted, one must never think about possibility or impossibility. If you look at the great creative minds, all so different, you will find they have one thing in common: They lack a fear of ridicule. 

**Game design is decision making, and decisions must be made with confidence** If you aren't failing, you aren't trying hard enough, and you aren't really a game designer.

## What Skills Does a Game Designer Need?

Almost anything that you can be good at can become a useful skill for a game designer. Some of the big ones:

* **Animation** — Modern games are full of characters that need to seem alive. The very word animation means *to give life*. Understanding the powers and limits will let you open the door for clever game design ideas the world has yet to see.
* **Anthropology** — You will be studying your audience trying to figure out their heart's desire, so that your games might satisfy that desire.
* **Architecture** — You will be designing more than buildings, you'll be designing whole cities and worlds. Understanding the relationship between people and spaces, will give you a tremendous leg up in creating game worlds.
* **Brainstorming** — You will need to create new ideas by the dozens, nay, by the hundreds.
* **Business** — The game industry is just that, an industry. Most games are made to make money. The better you understand the business end of things, the better chance you have of making the game of your dreams.
* **Cinematography** — Many games will have movies in them. You need to understand the art of cinematography if you want to deliver an emotionally compelling experience.
* **Communication** — You will need to talk with people. You will need to resolve disputes, solve problems of miscommunication, and learn the truth about how your teammates, your client, and your audience really feel about your game.
* **Creative Writing** — You will be creating entire fictional worlds, populations to live in them, and deciding the events that will happen there.
* **Economics** — Many modern games feature complex economies of game resources. An understanding of the rules of economics can be surprisingly helpful.
* **Engineering** — Modern videogames involve some of the most complex engineering in the world today New technical innovations make new kinds of gameplay possible. Innovative game designers must understand both the limits and the powers that each technology brings.
* **History** — Many games are placed in historical settings. Even ones placed in fantasy settings can draw incredible inspiration from history.
* **Management** — Good designers can succeed even when management is bad, secretly *managing from below* to get the job done.
* **Mathematics** — Games are full of mathematics, probability, risk analyses, complex scoring systems, not to mention the mathematics that stands behind computer graphics and computer science in general.
* **Music** — Music is the language of the soul. If your games are going to truly touch people, to immerse, and embrace them, they cannot do it without music.
* **Psychology** — Your goal is to make a human being happy. You must understand the workings of the human mind or you are designing in the dark.
* **Public Speaking** — You will frequently need to present your ideas to a group. Sometimes you will speak to solicit their feedback, speak to persuade of your new idea. You must be confident, clear, natural, and interesting, or people will be suspicious that you don't know what you are doing.
* **Sound Design** — Sound is what truly convinces the mind that it is in a place; in other words, *hearing is believing.*
* **Technical Writing** — You need to create documents that clearly describe your complex designs without leaving any holes or gaps.
* **Visual Arts** — Your games will be full of graphic elements. You must be fluent in the language of graphic design and know how to use it to create the feeling you want your game to have.

There are many more. How could anyone possibly master all of these things? The truth is that no one can. But the more of these things you are comfortable working with, however imperfectly, the better off you will be. This is another reason that game designers must be confident and fearless.

## The Most Important Skill - Listening

Of all the skills one is far the most important. Many people guess *creativity*, this is probably the second most important skill. Some guess *critical thinking* or *logic*, since game design is about decision making. These are indeed important, but by no means the most important skills. Some say *communication*, talking is certainly an important skill, but good communication and good game design are rooted in something far more basic and far more important.

**The most important skill for a game designer is listening**. Game designers must listen to many things. These can be grouped into five major categories: 

* Team
* Audience
* Game
* Client
* Self

By listening, I don't mean merely hearing what is said. I mean a **deeper listening, a thoughtful listening**. If you are just *surface listening*, you might draw that conclusions. But if you listen more deeply, paying full attention you might hear a very different message. When you listen thoughtfully you observe everything and constantly ask yourself questions.

When we listen deeply we put ourselves in a position of risk. **We accept that possibility that what we hear may upset us, may cause everything we know to be contradicted.** It is the ultimate in open-mindedness. It is the only way to learn the truth. You must approach everything as a child does, assuming nothing, observing everything.

> listen with a silent heart, with a waiting, open soul. Without passion, without desire, without judgment, without rebuke. - Herman Hesse in Siddharta

## The Five Kinds of Listening

Because game design is such an interconnected web, we will be visiting and revisiting the five kinds of listening, and exploring their interconnections throughout this book.

* **Listen to your team** (Chapters 23 and 24), since you will be building your game and making crucial game design decisions together with them.
* **Listen to your audience** (Chapters 8, 9, 21, 22, and 30) these are the people who will be playing your game. If they aren't happy with your game, you have failed. The only way to know what will make them happy is listening deeply, getting to know them better than they know themselves.
* **Listen to your game** (most chapters in the book). It means you will get to know your game inside and out. You will get to know what is wrong with your game by listening to it run.
* **Listen to your client** (Chapters 27–29). The client is the one who is paying you to design the game, and if you don't give them what they want, they'll go to someone else who does. Only by listening to them, deeply, will you be able to tell what they really want, deep in their hearts.
* **Listen to yourself** (Chapters 1, 6, and 32). This sounds easy, but for many, it is the most difficult kind of listening. If you can master it, however, it will be one of your most powerful tools, and the secret behind your tremendous creativity.

## The Secret of the Gifted

Your confidence might be fading already. You might be wondering whether game design is really for you. Skilled game designers seem to have a special gift for the work. It comes easily and naturally to them, and though you love games, you wonder if you are gifted enough to succeed as a designer. Well, here is a little secret about gifts. There are two kinds:

### The innate gift of a given skill

This **is the minor gift. If you have this gift, a skill such comes naturally to you.** You can do it easily, almost without thinking. But you don't necessarily enjoy doing it. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all kinds, who, though skilled, never do anything great with their gifted skill, and this is because they lack the major gift.

###  The nate gift is love of the work

This **is a major gift. If you have the major gift, the love of designing games, you will design games using whatever limited skills you have.** And you will keep doing it. And your love for the work will shine through, infusing your work with an indescribable glow that only comes from the love of doing it. 

Through practice, your game design skills will grow and become more powerful, until eventually your skills will be as great, or greater than, those of someone who only has the minor gift. 

But maybe you aren't sure if you have the major gift. You aren't sure if you truly love game design. There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift. Start down the path, and see if it makes your heart sing.
